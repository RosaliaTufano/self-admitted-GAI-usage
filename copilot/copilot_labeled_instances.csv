First test using Copilot Workspace.

Add a new middleware for validation using typebox.

* **Middleware Implementation**
  - Create `typeboxValidator` middleware in `packages/typebox-validator/src/typeboxValidator.ts`.
  - Define `WithBody` type and `typeboxValidator` function.
  - Implement validation logic using `TypeCompiler.Compile` and `TypeCompiler.Validate`.

* **Tests**
  - Add unit tests in `packages/typebox-validator/src/typeboxValidator.test.ts`.
  - Write tests for valid input, invalid input, and superfluous input.

* **Example**
  - Create an example usage in `packages/typebox-validator/examples/helloWorld.ts`.
  - Implement an AWS handler function using `typeboxValidator` middleware.
  - Add integration tests in `packages/typebox-validator/examples/helloWorld.int-test.ts`.

* **Configuration and Documentation**
  - Add `package.json` for the new middleware in `packages/typebox-validator/package.json`.
  - Create `README.md` with an overview and usage example in `packages/typebox-validator/README.md`.
  - Add TypeScript configuration files `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`.
  - Add Jest configuration files `jest.config.js` and `jest.integration.config.js`.

* **Test Setup**
  - Add test setup files in `packages/typebox-validator/test/` directory.
  - Include `.gitignore`, `handler.ts`, `serverless.yml`, `source-map-install.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `webpack.config.js`.

**Description**

The Copilot spec generated by Ogma includes the following comment for a
spec:

```
-- | Complete specification. Calls the C function void handler(); when
-- the property is violated.
```

That comment is inaccurate, since the name of the function executed may
not be `handler`.

**Type**

- Bug: Error in comment in generated code.

**Additional context**

None.

**Requester**

- Ivan Perez.

**Method to check presence of bug**

Error is in a comment. Check by visual inspection of the Copilot code
generated by Ogma.

Additionally, the following dockerfile runs the spec backend and checks
that the output no longer contains the fixed string ""handler();"", in
which case it prints the message ""Success"":

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:trusty

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install --yes software-properties-common
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:hvr/ghc
RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install --yes ghc-8.6.5 cabal-install-2.4
RUN apt-get install --yes libz-dev

ENV PATH=/opt/ghc/8.6.5/bin:/opt/cabal/2.4/bin:$PWD/.cabal-sandbox/bin:$PATH

RUN cabal update
RUN cabal v1-sandbox init
RUN cabal v1-install alex happy
RUN apt-get install --yes git

SHELL [""/bin/bash"", ""-c""]
CMD git clone $REPO \
    && cd $NAME \
    && git checkout $COMMIT \
    && cd .. \
    && cabal v1-sandbox init \
    && cabal v1-install $NAME/$PAT**/ --constraint=""aeson>=2.0.3.0"" \
    && ./.cabal-sandbox/bin/ogma fret-component-spec --fret-file-name $NAME/ogma-cli/examples/fret.json > Spec.hs \
    && ! grep 'handler();' Spec.hs \
    && echo ""Success""
```

Command (substitute variables based on new path after merge):

```sh
$ docker run -e ""REPO=https://github.com/NASA/ogma"" -e ""NAME=ogma"" -e PAT=""ogma-"" -e ""COMMIT=<HASH>"" -it ogma-verify-164
```

**Expected result**

The comment in the code generated by Copilot states that handlers are
executed, not that a specific function `handler();` is called.

Running the dockerfile above prints ""Success"", indicating that the
specific string ""handler();"" is no longer part of the output.

**Solution implemented**

Modify comment in `ogma-core/src/Language/Trans/Spec2Copilot.hs#L201` to
state that handlers (plural) are executed upon property violations.

**Further notes**

None."

- Originally messages were just one type - ""Messages"". But ""Messages""
can be used for different purposes (or not used for other purposes).
- We don't want to take internal messages into consideration when
extracting memories. We only want those to be public messages.
- For that, we have split messages into User, Assistant and Internal.
The Message type is now a union of these types.
- The input for creating these was also created to simplify the public
facing APIs (not in this PR).

## Description

This PR removes internal calls from Historian and Scribe to Riddler to
get tenant keys. Instead, it adds an API in Riddler that signs and
returns an access token directly. This is needed to support disabling
shared access keys for server tenants to support keyless access. With
this change access token signing is Riddler's responsibility. It itself
managed and signs tokens using private/shared keys instead of exposing
the private keys to other services. To maintain backward compatibility,
shared keys can still be retrieved using the `getKeys` API.

Overall changes summary:

1) Riddler `/accesstoken` API: This new API will sign an access token
for a given tenant. It will decide what keys to use based on the
tenant's configuration. If private access keys are enabled, it will
prioritize using those keys. Else it will use shared keys.
2) Riddler `/keys` API: This API has been modified to remove the
`usePrivateKeys` flag. This flag was intended to be for internal API
calls to fetch private keys. However, to support disabling `key` and
`secondaryKey` for a tenant, this flag has been removed. Now this API
only returns shared keys. If the tenant does not have shared keys, it
returns an object where `key1` and `key2` are empty.
3) RIddler `/tenant/:id` API: Adds a new parameter in the create tenant
API - `enableSharedKeyAccess`. When this is false, `key` and
`secondaryKey` are undefined. Both `enableSharedKeyAccess` and
`enablePrivateKeyAccess` cannot be false.
4) Riddler `/keyaccess` API: The `/keylessaccess` API has been modified
and made the `/keyaccess` API. This API is used to change a given
tenant's key access config. It allows to enable/disable shared key
access and private key access. In case shared key access is disabled,
`key` and `secondaryKey` are updated to be undefined. Both private and
shared key access cannot be false.
5) Historian and Scribe: Removed internal calls to Riddler's `getKeys`
API. Instead using the `signToken` API introduced to the
`ITenantManager` interface.

## Breaking Changes

Functionally, these changes maintain backward compatibility, i.e.
tenants will continue to function the way they have been. However, code
wise this introduces some changes that might be breaking:

1) Adds a new API to the `ITenantManager` interface. This is used to
make calls to Riddler to return a signed access token.
2) A package bump is needed in Historian base to consume the latest
`signToken` API changes. Till then the old `getKeys` API will continue
to be used.

## Reviewer Guidance

Changes needed to make `key` and `secondaryKey` optional in the
`ITenantDocument` interface. General review of any changes that might
break backward compatibility.

## Description

This PR adds a new module - `ResponseSizeMiddleware`. This class has a
method to validate response sizes to ensure that their byte sizes is
below a given a `maxResponseSizeInMegaBytes`. If the response body is
greater than `maxResponseSizeInMegaBytes`, an `HTTP 413` is sent as a
response, else the original response is sent back to the client. This is
introduced to primarily enforce response sizes in the storage stack
(Historian and Gitrest). A future PR will add this module to both
Gitrest and Historian after the r11 changes are merged.

Historian and Gitrest both have request size limitations. Hence, this PR
just adds support to limit response sizes. This is added to reduce the
chances of Gitrest returning very large responses that could result in
Historian running OOM.

## Description

This PR adds a fix for a bug introduced in
https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23407.
https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23407 removed internal
`getKey` API calls. However, the alternative to sign tokens by Riddler
was not working for cases where we spoof user tokens (Scribe -> Alfred,
Scribe -> Historian). This is because the token after expiry was never
refreshed.

This PR fixes this by adding a new callback to the `BasicRestWrapper` -
`refreshTokenIfNeeded`. This callback can handle refreshing auth tokens
if provided.

## Breaking Changes

This change should not have breaking changes.

## Reviewer Guidance

1) Unit testing
2) Code changes that refresh auth tokens in the new callback.

Add the code that will calculate the signature needed in the
objc_msgSend which will be the method that calls the native objc
message.

## Extra context

When we create a binding for a native type we need to be able to send
'messages' to the objc objects. From a C# developer perspective a
message can be considered a method. So for example, the following objc
code:
```objc
[object foo:bar];
```
Can be translated to: 
```c
objc_msgSend(object, sel_getUid(""foo:""), bar);
```
We can say this process is similar to reflection and the[ Invoke
method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.methodbase.invoke?view=net-9.0).
Our bindings provide methods around
[objc_msgsend](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1456712-objc_msgsend)
which we use to send the messaged with the arguments needed by the
message. For example, a property with a NSString backing fields defined
as:
```csharp
[Export (""text"")]
public string? Text { get; set; }
```
Results in the following generated code:
```csharp
[BindingImpl (BindingImplOptions.GeneratedCode | BindingImplOptions.Optimizable)]
public virtual string? Text {
	[Export (""text"")]
	get {
		global::UIKit.UIApplication.EnsureUIThread ();
		if (IsDirectBinding) {
			return CFString.FromHandle (global::ObjCRuntime.Messaging.NativeHandle_objc_msgSend (this.Handle, Selector.GetHandle (""text"")), false)!;
		} else {
			return CFString.FromHandle (global::ObjCRuntime.Messaging.NativeHandle_objc_msgSendSuper (this.SuperHandle, Selector.GetHandle (""text"")), false)!;
		}
	}
	[Export (""setText:"")]
	set {
		global::UIKit.UIApplication.EnsureUIThread ();
		var nsvalue = CFString.CreateNative (value);
		if (IsDirectBinding) {
			global::ObjCRuntime.Messaging.void_objc_msgSend_NativeHandle (this.Handle, Selector.GetHandle (""setText:""), nsvalue);
		} else {
			global::ObjCRuntime.Messaging.void_objc_msgSendSuper_NativeHandle (this.SuperHandle, Selector.GetHandle (""setText:""), nsvalue);
		}
		CFString.ReleaseNative (nsvalue);
	}
}
```
Our objc_msgSend method signatures are calculated based on the method
parameters and live in the runtime. These objc_msgSend calls are
generated by
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/main/runtime/bindings-generator.cs#L20
For example a objc_msgSend signature for a method that takes a string
and returns a string would be:
```c
IntPtr_objc_msgSend_IntPtr
```
But this is a simplifications because there is a diff between sending a
message to a super class (prefix super) or if it deals with a structure
(stret).

More info can be found in the Apple
[documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1456712-objc_msgsend).

Hi,

First of all, thanks for this project, it's great!! So we use copilot to deploy our service to two environments, `staging` and `production`. The images are both built from the same Dockerfile but with different `args`, so they do not contain the exact same code. After deploying `staging`, I noticed that the repo name in ECR doesn't contain the environment, just the app name and service name (`my_app/my_svc:[commit_hash]`).

If I deploy `production` now, the repo name and commit hash will be the same, but the image will be different, right? I'm thinking of using the `--tag` argument when building the images, to prevent this name clash:

```bash
% copilot svc deploy --env staging --name my_svc --tag $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)-staging
```

Is this the right way to proceed, or should somehow the repo name be `my_app/staging/my_svc` (I have found no way to change this)?

Thanks!"

Part of the [OSS Architecture track](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/discussions/61) 


## Task 
- [x] Within the [workflows directory](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/tree/main/.github/workflows), add and configure the [are you awake yet action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/are-they-awake-yet) for this project from this work in progress PR https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/pull/447
- [ ] Add inline comments


**Suggestions**: try this prompt with Copilot ""how to create a spellcheck GitHub Action like this one https://github.com/marketplace/actions/are-they-awake-yet"" 

**Or you can debug the following output:**
To create a GitHub Action in your ProgramEquity/amplify repository like the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" action, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your action.

2. Create a new file in your repository called Dockerfile with the following contents:

```FROM node:14-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT [""/entrypoint.sh""]
```
This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment and installs the curl package. It also copies the entrypoint.sh script to the container and sets it as the entrypoint.

3. Create a new file in your repository called entrypoint.sh with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/sh -l

curl -s https://awake-api.herokuapp.com/awake/$1 | grep -q ""true""
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo ""$1 is awake!""
  exit 0
else
  echo ""$1 is asleep :(""
  exit 1
fi
```

This shell script is the entrypoint for the Docker container. It uses the curl command to make a request to the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" API with the specified URL. It then uses grep to check if the response contains the string ""true"". If the URL is awake, it prints a success message and exits with code 0. If the URL is asleep, it prints a failure message and exits with code 1.

Create a new file in your repository called action.yml with the following contents:

```
name: Are They Awake Yet?
description: Check if a website is awake
inputs:
  url:
    description: 'The URL to check'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

This YAML file defines the GitHub Action. It specifies the name and description of the action, as well as an input for the URL to check. It also specifies that the action should run using Docker, and sets the Docker image to the Dockerfile we created earlier.

Commit and push your changes to the repository.

Use the actions/checkout action to check out the repository in your workflow.

Use the ProgramEquity/amplifyaction to run the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" action in your workflow, passing the URL to check as an input.

Part of the [OSS Architecture track](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/discussions/61) 

**User Story:** _To create a spellcheck GitHub Action like the austenstone/spellchecker-cli-action-summary action, you can use a spellchecking library like cspell or codespell, and use the actions/github-script action to post a summary of the spellcheck results as a comment on the pull request._

## Task 
- [ ] Within the [workflows directory](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/tree/main/.github/workflows), add and configure the [spellcheck action](https://github.com/austenstone/spellchecker-cli-action-summary) for this project
- [ ] Add inline comments

**Suggestions**: try this prompt with Copilot: ""how to create a spellcheck GitHub Action like this one https://github.com/austenstone/spellchecker-cli-action-summary"" 

or debug the following output:


**Directions:** 
Here's an example of how to create a spellcheck GitHub Action that posts a summary of the spellcheck results as a comment on the pull request:

Create a new GitHub repository for your spellcheck action.

Create a new file in your repository called Dockerfile with the following contents:

This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment and installs the cspell package globally.

Create a new file in your repository called entrypoint.sh with the following contents:

This shell script is the entrypoint for the Docker container. It runs the cspell command with any arguments passed to the script, and pipes the output to a file called spellcheck-results.txt. It then runs a Node.js script called index.js.

Create a new file in your repository called index.js with the following contents:

This Node.js script reads the spellcheck-results.txt file and extracts the misspelled words. It then formats the misspelled words as a comment body and posts the comment to the pull request using the GitHub API.

Create a new file in your repository called action.yml with the following contents:

This YAML file defines the GitHub Action. It specifies the name and description of the action, as well as an input for the path to the files to spellcheck. It also specifies that the action should run using Docker, and sets the Docker image to the Dockerfile we created earlier. Finally, it sets the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable to the value of the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN secret, which is automatically provided by GitHub.

Commit and push your changes to the repository.

Use the actions/checkout action to check out the repository in your workflow.

Use the actions/setup-node action to set up a Node.js environment in your workflow.

Use the your-username/your-repo-name action to run the spellcheck action in your workflow, passing the path to the files to spellcheck as an input.

Here's an example of how to use the your-username/your-repo-name action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

    ` name: Spellcheck
    
    on: [pull_request]
    
    jobs:
      spellcheck:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '14.x'
          - name: Spellcheck
            uses: your-username/your-repo-name@v1
            with:
              path: '.'
          - name: Post spellcheck results
            uses: actions/github-script@v4
            with:
              github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              script: |
            const context = github.context
            const octokit = github.getOctokit(core.getInput('token'))

            const results = fs.readFileSync('spellcheck-results.txt', 'utf8')
            const lines = results.split('\n')
            const misspelledWords = lines.slice(1, -2).map(line => line.trim())

            if (misspelledWords.length === 0) {
              console.log('No misspelled words found.')
              return
            }

            const body = `**Spellcheck Results:**

            ${misspelledWords.join('\n')}`

            await octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              body
            })`

In this example, we're using the your-username/your-repo-name action to run the spellcheck action. We're passing the path to the files to spellcheck as an input using the with directive.

We're also using the actions/github-script action to post a summary of the spellcheck results as a comment on the pull request. We're using the fs.readFileSync() method to read the spellcheck-results.txt file, and we're using the split() and map() methods to extract the misspelled words. We're then formatting the misspelled words as a comment body and posting the comment to the pull request using the GitHub API.

Part of the [OSS Architecture track](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/discussions/61) 


## Task 
- [] Within the [workflows directory](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/tree/main/.github/workflows), add and configure the [are you awake yet action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/are-they-awake-yet) for this project from this work in progress PR https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify/pull/447
- [ ] Add inline comments


**Suggestions**: try this prompt with Copilot ""how to create a spellcheck GitHub Action like this one https://github.com/marketplace/actions/are-they-awake-yet"" 

**Or you can debug the following output:**
To create a GitHub Action in your ProgramEquity/amplify repository like the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" action, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your action.

2. Create a new file in your repository called Dockerfile with the following contents:

```
FROM node:14-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT [""/entrypoint.sh""]
```

This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment and installs the curl package. It also copies the entrypoint.sh script to the container and sets it as the entrypoint.

3. Create a new file in your repository called entrypoint.sh with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/sh -l

curl -s https://awake-api.herokuapp.com/awake/$1 | grep -q ""true""
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo ""$1 is awake!""
  exit 0
else
  echo ""$1 is asleep :(""
  exit 1
fi
```

This shell script is the entrypoint for the Docker container. It uses the curl command to make a request to the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" API with the specified URL. It then uses grep to check if the response contains the string ""true"". If the URL is awake, it prints a success message and exits with code 0. If the URL is asleep, it prints a failure message and exits with code 1.

Create a new file in your repository called action.yml with the following contents:

```
name: Are They Awake Yet?
description: Check if a website is awake
inputs:
  url:
    description: 'The URL to check'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

This YAML file defines the GitHub Action. It specifies the name and description of the action, as well as an input for the URL to check. It also specifies that the action should run using Docker, and sets the Docker image to the Dockerfile we created earlier.

Commit and push your changes to the repository.

Use the actions/checkout action to check out the repository in your workflow.

Use the ProgramEquity/amplify action to run the ""Are They Awake Yet?"" action in your workflow, passing the URL to check as an input.

## Describe the bug

I am exploring the scenario of switching from manually managing DLP policies to managing them using Terraform.
I tried to use [the `terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import) and [the `import` block approach](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to achieve this, but without success.

### To Reproduce

#### `terraform import` command approach

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Get the ID of an existing DLP policy in the Power Platform Admin Center (_from the URL after opening a DLP policy or from network traces getting the list of the DLP policies_)
2. Set up a ""simple"" Terraform configuration with a DLP policy resource - like presented [here](https://microsoft.github.io/terraform-provider-power-platform/resources/data_loss_prevention_policy/)
3. Run the `terraform import command` - in the case of the configuration above, it would be something like `terraform powerplatform_data_loss_prevention_policy.my_policy <ID of the DLP policy you got from PPAC>`
4. You should get the following error - like I got [here](https://github.com/rpothin/PowerPlatform-Governance-With-Terraform/actions/runs/9458335426/job/26053668717):

```
│ Error: State Write Error
│ 
│ An unexpected error was encountered trying to retrieve type information at
│ a given path. This is always an error in the provider. Please report the
│ following to the provider developer:
│ 
│ Error: AttributeName(""Id"") still remains in the path: could not find
│ attribute or block ""Id"" in schema
```

#### `import` block approach

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Get the ID of an existing DLP policy in the Power Platform Admin Center (_from the URL after opening a DLP policy or from network traces getting the list of the DLP policies_)
2. Set up a ""simple"" Terraform configuration with a DLP policy resource and a related `import` block (_the ID of the DLP Policy to import could be static in your configuration or coming from a var file_) - like presented [here](https://github.com/rpothin/PowerPlatform-Governance-With-Terraform/blob/252182a4f8e670ddabf54f5ee9d94704d4cd9964/src/dlp-policies/main.tf#L20C1-L23C2)
3. Try to go through the ""classic"" plan and apply process
4. You should get the following error during the plan step - like I got [here](https://github.com/rpothin/PowerPlatform-Governance-With-Terraform/actions/runs/9474970108/job/26105519736):

```

Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

Error: State Write Error

An unexpected error was encountered trying to retrieve type information at a
given path. This is always an error in the provider. Please report the
following to the provider developer:

Error: AttributeName(""Id"") still remains in the path: could not find

Terraform Plan Failed!
```

### Sample Terraform Code - used in the `import` block approach

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source  = ""microsoft/power-platform""
      version = ""2.3.1-preview""
    }
  }

  backend ""azurerm"" {
    use_oidc = true
  }
}

provider ""powerplatform"" {
  use_oidc = true
}

data ""powerplatform_connectors"" ""all_connectors"" {}

import {
  to = powerplatform_data_loss_prevention_policy.policy
  id = var.id
}

resource ""powerplatform_data_loss_prevention_policy"" ""policy"" {
  display_name                      = var.display_name
  default_connectors_classification = ""Blocked""
  environment_type                  = var.environment_type
  environments                      = var.environments

  business_connectors     = var.business_connectors
  
  # Dynamically generate non-business connectors based on the business connectors specified
  non_business_connectors = [for conn in data.powerplatform_connectors.all_connectors.connectors : {
    id                           = conn.id
    name                         = conn.name
    default_action_rule_behavior = """"
    action_rules                 = [],
    endpoint_rules               = []
  } if conn.unblockable == true && !contains([for bus_conn in var.business_connectors : bus_conn.id], conn.id)]

  # Dynamically generate blocked connectors based on the business connectors specified
  blocked_connectors      = [for conn in data.powerplatform_connectors.all_connectors.connectors : {
    id                           = conn.id
    default_action_rule_behavior = """"
    action_rules                 = [],
    endpoint_rules               = []
  } if conn.unblockable == false && !contains([for bus_conn in var.business_connectors : bus_conn.id], conn.id)]

  custom_connectors_patterns = var.custom_connectors
}
```

### Expected behavior

I would like to be able to successfully execute the `terraform import` command or to use the `import` block approach to import an existing DLP policy into a state file to be able to switch the management of its configuration to Terraform.

## System Information

 - Provider Version: `2.3.1-preview`
 - OS & Version: GitHub Codespace with [this configuration](https://github.com/rpothin/PowerPlatform-Governance-With-Terraform/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)

## Additional context

After some research and analysis, I think the issue is coming from the implementation of the [`ImportState` method for the DLP policy resource](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/blob/51e1bba2e77973d845cee783fbacba5c20b81d64/internal/powerplatform/services/dlp_policy/resource_dlp_policy.go#L414C1-L416C2).

Like mentioned in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/migrating/resources/import#framework), the resource state should be set in `resource.ImportStateResponse` and it does not seem to be the case currently.

I am not sure if `path.Root(""Id"")` in the call to the [ImportStatePassthroughID](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#ImportStatePassthroughID) works as expected.

Based on a long discussion with GitHub Copilot to try to understand this issue, I think a fix like the one below could potentially work:

```go
func (r *resourceDlpPolicy) ImportState(ctx context.Context, req resource.ImportStateRequest, resp *resource.ImportStateResponse) error {
    id := req.ID

    // Use the id to retrieve the DLP policy from your service
    policy, err := r.apiClient.GetDlpPolicy(ctx, id)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Create a new instance of your resource's state and populate it with the policy's data
    state := &resourceDlpPolicyState{
        ID:     policy.ID,
        Name:   policy.Name,
        // Populate other fields as necessary
    }

    // Use the state to set the resource's state in the response
    resp.State = state

    return nil
}
```

What do you think?

## Contribution

<!--
Thank you for contributing to Shopware! Please fill out this description template to help us to process your pull request.

Please make sure to fulfil our contribution guideline (https://developer.shopware.com/docs/resources/guidelines/code/contribution?category=shopware-platform-dev-en/contribution).

Do your changes need to be mentioned in the documentation?
Please create a second pull request at https://github.com/shopware/docs
-->

### 1. Why is this change necessary?

Its a small simplification and reduces a complexity of maintenance. Also uses MariaDB pre-release images to avoid unexpected regressions.

mariadb-devel:verylatest corresponds to a RC version so its currently 11.3 as seen by the right hand side groupings and equivalent manifest on https://quay.io/repository/mariadb-foundation/mariadb-devel?tab=tags.

### 2. What does this change do, exactly?

The overriding of the entrypoint of mysql and mariadb was a little moot in they both accepted command line options and didn't need mysqld/mariadbd there.

Normalizes the command of special options using the --loose-* prefix that both MySQL and MariaDB will ignore if not recognised for uniform. Added the InnoDB force primary key as equivalent.

per #3273 added quay.io/mariadb-foundation/mariadb-devel:verylatest so any regressions can be found pre-release.

### 3. Describe each step to reproduce the issue or behaviour.

Run in ci, hoping it works as only did a dry edit and looked at gitlab documentation for `command:` format.

### 4. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).

* #3273

First, great app that does what's advertise! 

From what I understand, it is possible to upload my own files to a repo and get them to work on Soundbound.

I've been able to create a repo of 29 mp3 songs from my PC using Visual Studio 2022, but been unable to see them appear on the app. (FYI, I've waited an hour for the songs to upload, tried with only one song in a folder from my desktop and it doesn't work.)

Is there something I'm doing wrong? 

Note that i used a very clear step-by-step how-to from Copilot AI since I'm only a tech-savvy beginner on GitHub!

---
[severity:Other]
I was using CoPilot to create a Conda environment file.  CoPilot suggested that I select ""Open in PowerShell"" from the Python Environments menu in Visual Studio and enter the following command: conda activate ""myenvironment"". When I entered the text, I received an error message that ""conda"" was not recognized (please see the text below). I was able to open an anaconda prompt from the start menu and generate the environment file.  I do not know whether generating an environment file ""myenvironment.yml"" is supported by Visual Studio.  There may also be issues with generating an accurate ""requirements.txt"" file in that the generated file does not reflect the selected environment.

conda : The term 'conda' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check
the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

Hi @zhigangjiang 
I tried the HuggingFace demo app and it was good <3, but it's taking too much time with 1024, So I decided to install the model on my computer since I have a fairly good one.
I'm like a fish in the desert (hardly know anything about codes/programming).
With lots of help from Copilot Ai chat and 2 whole days, I could not run the model on my PC.

I tired 3 ways
1. **pip install -r requirements.txt**  = _didn't know what to do after that._
2. Setup **Anaconda** and make an environment to run the model = _lots of errors._
3. Setup **Docker** and make an image and container to run it like any Windows program = **docker build?** _YES_ **docker run?** _NO_  
These are the codes that appeared to me after writing the run command.  [Docker issue.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17653948/Docker.issue.txt)
I think these errors is solvable and it's related to some google drive files but seems that Copilot can't handle it no more.

Could you help me by reading the **Docker.issue.txt** file and tell me what is the problem that is preventing Docker from running the model and how to overcome these problems?"

I just discovered this DMF project a few days ago.

It looks like a fantastic time-saver!

I have mostly been reading up on it and working with CoPilot to write some theoretical code for it.
(TMI: My planned use case is for a `Dmf_VirtualHidKeyboard`)

Being new to DMF, getting started using it is a little more intimidating than getting started with just the WDK.
WDK is brain dead easy to start using by adding `Microsoft.Windows.WDK` as a nuget dependency.

Are there any plans to create a DMF nuget package for easier inclusion into a KMDF/WDF project?

Is this even possible, or is it intentional that someone must clone/download the DMF repo and then compile it on their own before they can use it in their project?

Thanks.

Ok so this seemed like a #good first issue, so I decided to try to fix it... problem is _I don't know really any coding_, but I thought I would give it a try, I even tried to get GitHub copilot to help me, but all I got was the directory where I [think ](src/settings-ui/Settings.UI/SettingsXAML/Controls/ShortcutControl/ShortcutControl.xaml.cs) the changes need to be made (turn on word wrap or maybe a bigger dialog box or something like that...)

Generated using Copilot from Messages in the Buefy Discord

**Buefy** version: ?.?.?
**Vuejs** version: ?.?.?
**OS/Browser**:

Description:
Coming from the first stages of migration to Vue 3, I initially had to enter the git URL in package.json (""buefy"": ""https://github.com/ntohq/buefy-next"") to make it work. Switching from that to the current node module via yarn remove buefy and yarn add buefy@npm:@ntohq/buefy-next causes the active classes in b-menu not to work (:class=""{ 'is-active': menuPageIndex === activePage }""). If I revert back to the git URL, everything works fine. This issue persists regardless of whether I use Node 18.20.4 or 22.11.0.

### Steps to Reproduce:
Migrate to Vue 3 and update package.json with the git URL ""buefy"": ""https://github.com/ntohq/buefy-next"".
Switch to the node module via yarn remove buefy and yarn add buefy@npm:@ntohq/buefy-next.
Observe that active classes in b-menu no longer work.

### Expected Behavior:
Active classes in b-menu should work correctly with the node module as they do with the git URL.

### Environment:
Node version: 18.20.4 and 22.11.0

### Describe the feature you'd like

Basically just have a way to import cookies for sites that require login and have custom browser steps so it will click buttons then scrape so for example, on YouTube, it will click the accept button so it has more context on what the site is or just clicking past a newsletter sign up.

### Describe the benefits this would bring to existing Hoarder users

It would be useful so the AI has more context about the page, rather than just a newsletter sign-up, allowing the user to use Hoarder the way it was intended: easily searching and tagging bookmarks.

### Can the goal of this request already be achieved via other means?

I think it can be done in puppeteer which I think this is using(I just asked github copilot to find out). I just got ChatGPT to help me code this:
```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto('https://www.youtube.com/');
  
  const searchQuery = 'Puppeteer tutorial';

  await page.type('input[name=""search_query""]', searchQuery);
  
  await Promise.all([
    page.waitForNavigation(),
    page.click('button[aria-label=""Search""]'),
  ]);
  
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'youtube_search_result.png' });

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Have you searched for an existing open/closed issue?

- [x] I have searched for existing issues and none cover my fundamental request

### Additional context

I tried searching for ""automation"", ""Custom Clicks"" and a few other terms so I don't think it exists"

        ""ui.semanticTokens"": true
    },
```

### Describe the bug

When asking Github Copilot to create a test, after it generates a test case that compiles, if I click on 'Run test' above the test definition, VSCode asks me if I want to save the file created by AI, and the whole window hangs.

See attached video below, and the debug logs with `code --verbose --log 'debug'`

[less-output.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18436904/less-output.txt)



### Steps to reproduce the behavior:
0. Make sure that the default action when saving a file generated by Github Copilot is to ask before saving (not sure if it matters really)
1. Have Github Copilot generate a test, and wait for the Go extension to collect test the
2. Click on 'Run test' that appears above the test definition
3. VsCode asks to save the file, but nothing can be clicked, the page hangs

183,679aec23dde7f79e9cc6dfe4,pull-request,software quality -> refactoring,https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/11268,"RevisionGraph: improve internal structures
## Proposed changes

General changes to improve cpu execution and to
limit allocations. Some changes are very minor like
using for instead of foreach, other changes the data structures.

Separate storage of nodes that has no GitRevision.
This allows to remove a separate node storage and
to simplify the code.

Use ImmutableArray instead of array and list for the ordered caches
to improve allocations.

Force update data grid when revision graph nodes have been modified

The order of nodes in the revision graph may change if the commits are
listed out of order or if artificial commits are inserted.
The revision graph was (normally) invalidated but the data grid was only
refreshed if scrolling.

Use separate counter for revisions to limit
the lock time for _revisionByObjectId.Count

Rename variables and add comments

Remove unused IsRevisionRelative().

--

This is partly a test of how you can use CoPilot to optimize code.
It is maybe 1/5 times you get something that works and 1/10 that something works.
Quite often CoPilot insists on something that is not an improvement.
But that is not so bad, there are improvements in the end. 

This code is running when revisions are loaded, so performance is important.
Also minor changes could make a difference.

I will add some comments about decisions in an own review of the code.

Tests mostly on Linux repo, limiting loading to 100K commits.

This reduces the time RevisionDataGridView.Add() runs from about 1000-1400 ms to 400-600ms.
However, the normal load time (as reported by RevisionReader) is mostly unchanged at 3000 - 3400 ms, so it seem like git-log delivers commits slower than they are handled here. 
The total time for git-log to write to a file is about 1900 ms so there is something more to it, maybe something with reading the stream (there are changes in .NET7 I will try later).
So there may be a potential for some minor improvements later.
The decreased allocation seem to give more consistent running times (less gc).

The incorrect insertion of artificial commits (that #11266 made more visible) is fixed at least.
I still get some visual issues when scrolling a lot, but better than before.
Similar with no grid when rebasing, I have not seen that lately.
More changes may be needed lock-cache-refresh handling, this is a step forward.
## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->

There are tests for graph loading.

## Merge strategy

I agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).

## Description

This PR contains the syntax changes for the codebase. For better efficiency it has been supported with Github Copilot with avoidance of changes in code logic or potentially dangerous changes (! vs undefined, for... of / forEach). Since this PR is rather vast, I've listed the changes below.

The changes include:

- Changing module system to ES modules (import / export syntax with aliases and default export wherever possible).
- Implementing default node [subpath import system](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) which required changes in package.json (paths starting with #) and jsconfig.json (for VS Code intelli-sense support, [more here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52460). The changes has been done as the module-alias doesn't seem to work well with ES modules - [more here](https://github.com/ilearnio/module-alias/issues/59).
- Changing existing functions to ES6 arrow functions syntax.
- Introducing ES6 template literals syntax.
- Shortening property assignments and dot properties.
- Correct stylistic errors (letter cases, semicolons, spacing).

## Related Issues

#427 

## Steps to Test

Since  changes relate to syntax, the testing methodology was UAT (checking the functionality from user perspective), checking VSCode intelli-sense and functioning of changed modules.

# Added blocking Open to message sender.

While debugging the producer batch stress test, I discovered that the reason that the test doesn't work is because the `MessageSender::Open` method returned before the connection had actually been opened, thus the peer max message size was unavailable.

This change fixes that. As an additional bonus, it adds support for a new macro `AZURE_NODISCARD` which adds `[[nodiscard]]` semantics to the SDK as an option for future SDKs.

Because the AMQP SDK is not yet released, added _azure_NODISCARD support to several AMQP APIs, with potentially more to come later. 

This pull request also makes the eventhubs stress tests work correctly and generate traces which can be read from the stress dashboard.

This pull request primarily focuses on improving the thread-safety of the `GraphQLQueryPagerCoordinator` class in the `apollo-ios-pagination` package. The changes involve converting the `canLoadNext` and `canLoadPrevious` properties to atomic properties and updating the way they are mutated.

Here are the most important changes:

This ensures that the assignment operation is atomic, further improving thread-safety."

A bit of an idea I had to ease usage in SwiftUI.

If an `@Observable` view model owns a pager, we cannot observe value changes (`onChange(...)`) of the whole `viewModel`, as the pager breaks conformance. Whether that's a good pattern or not (I think _probably not?_) is a bit besides the point, as I can see some users doing it anyways. 

There are various values stored on the pager classes – the underlying coordinator, the cancellables, etc – but at its core, the underlying data state is what matters, i.e., the value of `_subject`. 

Note: I don't think I can return `lhs._subject.value == rhs._subject.value` since the value is a `Result<(Model, UpdateSource), Error>`. Even if `Model`, `UpdateSource`, and `Error`, are equatable, the tuple value of `(Model, UpdateSource)` is not equatable – thus failing to translate conditional equatability to the `Result`.

This pull request includes changes to the Apollo iOS Pagination package to improve the comparability and hashability of certain classes and enums. The most important changes include adding `Equatable` conformance to `AsyncGraphQLQueryPager` and `GraphQLQueryPager` classes, and making the `UpdateSource` enum `Hashable`.

Here are the most significant changes:

* [`apollo-ios-pagination/Sources/ApolloPagination/AsyncGraphQLQueryPager.swift`](diffhunk://#diff-bbd20683d6ef1206d7aae2b688f4b2124f812c95aae7af409761c48c322399a1R248-R263): Added `Equatable` protocol conformance to `AsyncGraphQLQueryPager`. This allows for equality comparison between instances of `AsyncGraphQLQueryPager` where `Model` is also `Equatable`. The equality is determined by comparing the values and sources of the subjects of the two `AsyncGraphQLQueryPager` instances, or by comparing the localized descriptions of their errors if they both have errors.

## Overiew:

As part of my Bachelor Thesis on creating a SCION Traffic Simulator with Beacon Meta-data, I made some changes and additions to the scion implementation in seed as well as to some other parts of the seed-emulator. Firstly I added the possibility to specify link properties on CrossConnect(XC) and InternetExchange(IX) links. Secondly I also added the possibility to specify which scion border routers to connect for routing. This allows for more flexibility when connecting different ASes (e.g. several links between different routers of the same two ASes). Thirdly I added the possibility to generate a `staticInfoConfig.json` file on the control service nodes, so that link properties are included in the beacons as meta data. There are also some other smaller changes that are detailed in the list below.

I tried to adhere to the general style of the codebase and the contribution guidelines. Also I am happy to implement suggestions that would make my code more in line with this project.

## Changes and Additions:

1. **Enhanced Link Configuration:**
   - Added the ability to specify link properties on xc and ix links.
   
2. **Extended Connectivity Options:**
   - Implemented the option to connect specific Scion border routers instead of being limited to only connecting ASes.

3. **Improved Beacon Information:**
   - Included link properties in `staticInfoConfig.json` on Control Service nodes to ensure their inclusion in the beacons.

4. **Documentation Enhancements:**
   - Added a note to both `ScionAutonomousSystem` and `Node` classes.
   - Included geolocation data in Node class.

5. **New Service Creation:**
   - Created a `scion-bwtestclient` Service.

6. **Examples and Explanations:**
   - Added examples demonstrating and explaining all the new features.

## Summary

Relocating the Visual Studio Marketplace publishing logic from GitHub to Azure DevOps, to switch from PATs to Workload Identity Federation. This update also includes a small optimisation when testing the latest PR Metrics release.

## Detailed Copilot Generated Summary (manually refined)

These changes include significant updates to the Azure DevOps pipeline configuration files and the GitHub workflow file. They focus on modifying the release process and improving the build process. The most significant changes are the addition of a new `release.yml` file, the modification of the `template.yml` file to change the build stages, and the removal of the ""Publish Release"" step from the `release-phase-2.yml` file.

Addition of new configuration:

* [`.github/azure-devops/release.yml`](diffhunk://#diff-25f998e817515523e95edd3b4e0eb06fad5909deec7e3d4b7d57f4912cb39349R1-R110): A new configuration file has been added that sets up a new Azure DevOps pipeline for releases. The pipeline is triggered by tags starting with 'v' and does not run for pull requests. It includes jobs for checks, release, and publishing to the Azure DevOps marketplace.

Modifications to existing configuration:

* [`.github/azure-devops/template.yml`](diffhunk://#diff-9ba73744bad564cb8afb7eac4a1ffce0822431667e90f80de88300f094aae565L15-R30): The build stages have been modified. The ""Deploy"" job has been replaced with a ""Prerequisites"" job. The ""Delay"" job has been removed and the ""PRMetrics_macOS"" job now depends on the ""Prerequisites"" job. These changes streamline the build process and optimize the use of resources. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-9ba73744bad564cb8afb7eac4a1ffce0822431667e90f80de88300f094aae565L15-R30) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-9ba73744bad564cb8afb7eac4a1ffce0822431667e90f80de88300f094aae565L72-R82)

Removal of redundant configuration:

* [`.github/workflows/release-phase-2.yml`](diffhunk://#diff-c7e4bd8feb36835f6722b91d36ca67dcad2ece6f364e0404754016195651f1b0L72-L79): The ""Publish Release"" step has been removed from the workflow. This step was previously used to publish the extension to the Azure DevOps marketplace. The new `release.yml` file now manages this process."

Need suggestions: https://opendevin.slack.com/archives/C06TL7AJMK2/p1715848998465029

[Created with Copilot Workspace]
Related to #1787

Implements an animated three dots indicator in the chat UI to signal when the agent is generating a response.

- Adds a conditional rendering block within `ChatInterface.tsx` to display the animated three dots indicator using the `ChatMessage` component when the `curAgentState` is set to `AgentState.LOADING`.
- The indicator appears in the chat UI immediately after a user sends a message and is removed when the agent's response is ready to be displayed, enhancing user experience by providing visual feedback during response generation.

Added the missing comment to the `regression_2606()` test.  I was not sure where the hex value came from that was used to test that the deserialization fails.

This PR was entirely made using Github Copilot Workspace.
Some small optimizations need to be done before merging.

---

Closes #16

Implements a retry mechanism for file and directory deletion operations, enhancing error handling and user interaction.

- **Error Handling Enhancements**
  - Adds `TryDeleteDirectoryWithRetry` and `TryDeleteFileWithRetry` methods in `Utils.cs` to attempt deletion with a retry mechanism. These methods loop until the operation succeeds, the user decides to skip, or the user quits the program.
  - Incorporates user prompts within the retry mechanism, offering options to retry, skip, or quit upon encountering deletion errors.
  
- **Integration with Existing Code**
  - Utilizes the new retry mechanism methods in `BoothBatchDownloader.cs` for deleting directories and files. This ensures that if a deletion fails, the user is prompted with options to handle the error gracefully.
  - Modifies directory and file deletion logic to use the retry mechanism, improving robustness against locked files or other deletion errors.

Copilot Generated Summary
-----------------------------

This pull request primarily focuses on simplifying the file collection process in the `src/files.rs` file and adding a new dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file. The most significant changes include the addition of the `ignore` crate to the project dependencies, the use of the `Walk` struct from the `ignore` crate to collect files, and the removal of several functions related to file collection that are no longer necessary.

Dependency addition:

* [`Cargo.toml`](diffhunk://#diff-2e9d962a08321605940b5a657135052fbcef87b5e360662bb527c96d9a615542R25): Added `ignore` crate version ""0.4.22"" to the project dependencies. This crate provides the `Walk` struct used for file collection.

File collection simplification:

* [`src/files.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-5bf5ae12e63725209487d4de26d9a2bd9696e7beffb5cf984898c8d864d3721aR3-L4): Imported the `Walk` struct from the `ignore` crate.
* [`src/files.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-5bf5ae12e63725209487d4de26d9a2bd9696e7beffb5cf984898c8d864d3721aL78-L139): Simplified the `collect_default_target_files` function by using the `Walk` struct to collect files instead of the previous method, which involved checking if the current directory is a git repository and collecting files differently based on that. Removed the `collect_files_with_git` and `collect_files_without_git` functions as they are no longer necessary.
* [`src/files.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-5bf5ae12e63725209487d4de26d9a2bd9696e7beffb5cf984898c8d864d3721aL153-L165): Removed the `is_git_repository` function as it is no longer needed due to the changes in the file collection process."

Copilot Generated Summary
-----------------------------

This pull request primarily focuses on changes in two files: `efmt_core/src/items/macros.rs` and `efmt_core/src/parse/token_stream.rs`. The changes in `macros.rs` involve parsing and formatting improvements for `MacroArg`, as well as the addition of a new test for `assert_match`. In `token_stream.rs`, the changes revolve around the expansion of macros with arguments and predefined macros.

Parsing and Formatting Improvements:

219,679b400fdde7f79e9cc752a7,pull-request,process -> automating commit/issue/PR creation -> creating commit/issue/PR description,https://github.com/microsoft/vs-mef/pull/508,"Fix support for 2-deep arrays
##  Add support for nested arrays

For this test, we use a metadata view member typed as a nested array to demonstrate the need for this support. I suspect that it could also manifest as an imported/exported value typed with a nested array.
In the metadata view case, this is useful when a single metadatum has a `T[]` value, and the metadata is provided by an `AllowMultiple=true` attribute, such that all metadata gets an array added to it.

##  Fix testing of `string[]` IsMultiple=true metadata

This isn't likely to impact a shipping scenario, but by-value equality testing didn't handle nested arrays, which upset the new test I was adding.

## Copilot generated explanations

This pull request includes changes to improve array equality checks, resolve metadata tokens more accurately, and add new test cases for custom export metadata values. The changes are divided into enhancements to array equality checks, improvements to metadata token resolution, and additions to test cases.

### Enhancements to Array Equality Checks:
* Modified the `Equals` method to call the instance method `ArrayEquals` directly, removing the need for a translator function in `ByValueEquality.cs`. (`src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/ByValueEquality.cs`, [src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/ByValueEquality.csL254-R262](diffhunk://#diff-2336982ba1fb70f3e9c5c6db7c2c75f0d0f4b96337dab0a6bcf5da5427345b26L254-R262))
* Simplified the `ArrayEquals` method by removing the translator function and directly comparing array elements using the `Equals` method. (`src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/ByValueEquality.cs`, [src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/ByValueEquality.csL271-R273](diffhunk://#diff-2336982ba1fb70f3e9c5c6db7c2c75f0d0f4b96337dab0a6bcf5da5427345b26L271-R273))

### Improvements to Metadata Token Resolution:
* Removed an unnecessary argument check for `metadataToken` in the `TypeRef` constructor, as it is always valid when the token is a type. (`src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Reflection/TypeRef.cs`, [src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Reflection/TypeRef.csL64](diffhunk://#diff-559562fd6b32d39b0af86894b1fa58d549ffec7070996a8f2df15cccb172e4a3L64))
* Added a condition to handle metadata tokens representing arrays in the `ResolvedType` property, ensuring that array element types are resolved correctly. (`src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Reflection/TypeRef.cs`, [src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Reflection/TypeRef.csR201-R213](diffhunk://#diff-559562fd6b32d39b0af86894b1fa58d549ffec7070996a8f2df15cccb172e4a3R201-R213))
* Removed the unused localized string `UnresolvableMetadataToken` from `Strings.Designer.cs` and `Strings.resx`. (`src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Strings.Designer.cs`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-c3e25fc77a50a9cbcb837d012c729402959def2b506328fc360be5af3b71948eL687-L695); `src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Strings.resx`, [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-7e109510a200007f540b4cc6845712181b317aa92a9314df717dc59b45bc61c7L247-L249)

### Additions to Test Cases:
* Added new test methods to verify handling of multiple custom export metadata values with string arrays in `ExportMetadataMultipleTests.cs`. (`test/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition.Tests/ExportMetadataMultipleTests.cs`, [test/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition.Tests/ExportMetadataMultipleTests.csR38-R73](diffhunk://#diff-eb9fde8361e8feb7b77d0f5dd2973c6f6932278ea0225619c2ba441af62683b9R38-R73))
* Introduced new classes and attributes to support the added test cases for custom metadata with string arrays. (`test/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition.Tests/ExportMetadataMultipleTests.cs`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-eb9fde8361e8feb7b77d0f5dd2973c6f6932278ea0225619c2ba441af62683b9R110-R115) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-eb9fde8361e8feb7b77d0f5dd2973c6f6932278ea0225619c2ba441af62683b9R128-R165)"
220,679b4090dde7f79e9cc7552b,pull-request,documentation -> generating code comments,https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/pull/2326,"docs: add detailed docstrings to DBInfo methods and classes
Follow-up of #2064, just as a demonstration for showing other handy tools besides ChatGPT.

This is mainly to demonstrate some tools that can aid in generating docstrings.

From the commit message:
- Corrected a typo in the DBInfo class description.
- Added detailed docstrings to various methods and properties in the DBInfo class
- Added class-level docstrings to subclasses of DBInfo to describe their purpose.
- Enhanced the FindAnvioDBs class docstring by adding missing parameters.
- Improved the listdir and walk methods in it with detailed docstrings.

Background infos:
- Human brain cells were used to establish the indented docstring formatting by looking for existing docstrings in the project writing examples based on them and by opening other files in VS Code that already use this docstring parameter format for GitHub Copilot to use as examples to produce the expected formatting.
  - Brain cells were also used to check the validity of the generated docstrings and to find missing/undocumented parameters and a short docstring that could be improved.
- Typos found using in VS Code using the [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) plugin.
- Docstrings generated interactively in VS Code, mostly using tab completion using GitHub Copilot
  - and to a lesser extent using the [VS Code Sourcery Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcery.sourcery) 
- Review of the changes and initial changelog generated using [VS Code Sourcery Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcery.sourcery) as well.
  - The review by Sourcery was very accurate and led to further fixes.
  - The changelog generated as the 1st part of the review of the changes was very detailed, so I trimmed it to be a more brief bullet-point list."

This is draft from copilot workspace as a starter for #2192 

Add a setting option to toggle backup of settings to app storage.

Pending: testing disable of sync shouldn't remove the stored data, so you could retoggle it back on and it should restore based on whatever was last there.
This didn't work yet, but the initial sync seemed to be toggled without error. 

Also this is local storage and pretty sure that's a nice backup for local but wouldn't sync remotely, so this is just a start.

# Generated by Copilot

This pull request to the `lua/js-i18n` module includes significant changes to improve the handling of source inputs and enhance the functionality of the language server protocol (LSP). The most important changes are grouped into improvements to query handling, LSP enhancements, and utility adjustments.

### Improvements to query handling:
* [`lua/js-i18n/analyzer.lua`](diffhunk://#diff-fab82b4775c895377079312fa62282d5549ec543c3fbcfb07241100d3de54eb4L74-R86): Replaced `bufnr` with a more flexible `source` parameter, which can be either a buffer number or a string source. This change affects multiple functions, including `get_node_for_key`, `parse_get_t`, `parse_call_t`, and `find_call_t_expressions`.

### LSP enhancements:
* [`lua/js-i18n/lsp/config.lua`](diffhunk://#diff-d7c58276f6e9fdc8b2a3d3e2234f64efc27dba41a2bb2e9114956e2d3cc47249R6-R8): Introduced a reference table for each workspace to manage translation references more effectively.
* `lua/js-i18n/lsp/protocol/notify/text_document_did_change.lua` and `lua/js-i18n/lsp/protocol/notify/text_document_did_open.lua`: Added logic to initialize and update the reference table when documents change or open.

### Utility adjustments:
* [`lua/js-i18n/lsp/checker.lua`](diffhunk://#diff-551baebe4f41242369dac333b1e9072cdd88cce23b0703d1a5be12a57ee0548dL13-R13): Modified the `check` function to use `workspace_dir` instead of `bufnr` for detecting the library.

I added a `pyproject.toml` file to make this project installable using the command `!pip install git+https://github.com/Arhosseini77/SUM.git`. Additionally, I integrated the Hugging Face platform to enable the use of a pre-trained model uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub. (I uploaded the same Google Drive model to https://huggingface.co/safe-models/SUM.)

## Summary

> RFC: https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/discussions/8646

In the previous design, there would be a complete backup of the storage data items in the memory to ensure that the incremental data could be updated correctly, and then look for an opportunity to synchronize to the disk. Even if the synchronization failed, no rollback operation was needed.

However, this would lead to a long-term occupation of memory, increasing the overall memory overhead by 20%~30%. But if these memories were released directly, a large number of files would need to be read again in the next update for reasonable packing. Therefore, the concept of generations (similar to the mem cache of webpack) was introduced.

Each storage update would increase the generation, which usually occurred at the end of a compilation. For each data item, the generation in which it was produced would be retained, and the generation of the data pack would be the maximum value of the generations of all the data in this pack. After the data in a data pack changed, the data would be poured out of the pack. At this time, for the poured data and the changed data, since they must be written to the file, they could be sorted by generation at this time, and the data generated earlier would be placed in a pack together, so that they were less likely to be modified.

For the data packs that were not modified in the memory and were generated recently (determined by `fresh_generation`), they could also be poured and added to the optimization to improve the effect. If the generation of the data packs was quite different from the current one (determined by `release_generation`), it meant that this data pack had not been modified recently and could be released from the memory. But only the contents of the data items in these packs would be released, not the keys of the data items in the packs. When the data item in the package was modified, the file would need to be read again to obtain the contents of the pack again, and this would trigger file reading. However, since the generation was only detected and the data was released after the file was clearly written, reading the file was usually reliable.

## Summary

Fix https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues/8839

Currently, using synchronous functions in `externals` will directly lead to timeout. Webpack has the same problem. But this problem can be judged based on the parameters and return values of the function. If the parameters do not contain a callback and the return value is not a promise, it is determined to be a synchronous function.

This pull request introduces several changes to the handling of external items and their configuration in the `rspack` project. The most important changes include the addition of synchronous external functions, updates to test cases, and modifications to the configuration schema.

### Handling of external items:
* Added support for synchronous external functions in the `ExternalItem` type definition and handling logic (`packages/rspack/src/config/types.ts`, `packages/rspack/src/builtin-plugin/ExternalsPlugin.ts`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-790d97d1c7c2bfbbe7720a38355ec1e0d462206a5ddb9826c6aa8bff7090ce0fR1428) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-626d01111d55d87a0fc62e3ff431569c3e81187b6ce04f6be32e3d45713c0361L111-R128).

### Test cases:
* Added new test cases to validate the handling of various types of externals, including synchronous functions (`packages/rspack-test-tools/tests/configCases/externals/function-sync/index.js`, `packages/rspack-test-tools/tests/configCases/externals/function-sync/inject.js`, `packages/rspack-test-tools/tests/configCases/externals/function-sync/rspack.config.js`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-7b6a424200555584c3d714638b1d9e915323ff21694852def2597ad4f0fbc8e8R1-R30) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-40f163dfc9c5f068b5d27c22c704561ea517b3a6990b00bc0ce8a140d96c2951R1-R3) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-754c59fbef9413e28cb46f13f1df1ea52607351c3c84e5d92e03d06d6e82998cR1-R31).

### Configuration schema:
* Updated the Zod schema to include synchronous external functions (`packages/rspack/etc/core.api.md`, `packages/rspack/src/config/zod.ts`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-f4bb41255e2a0ade53712cc35847d3bcd0420ea7fe138fd3618e0b2b097e7bf1L2038-R2038) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-f4bb41255e2a0ade53712cc35847d3bcd0420ea7fe138fd3618e0b2b097e7bf1L6647-R6647) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-f4bb41255e2a0ade53712cc35847d3bcd0420ea7fe138fd3618e0b2b097e7bf1L8672-R8672) [[4]](diffhunk://#diff-f4bb41255e2a0ade53712cc35847d3bcd0420ea7fe138fd3618e0b2b097e7bf1L9276-R9276) [[5]](diffhunk://#diff-ab55c721fbd8c96920ce320fb0cac86aedc50b87e4e360ca3f54c2029b0c0ffcR919-R924).

> Generated using Github Copilot Workspace 

Prompt Used: 

```
Summary: Add an option to select the voice for different languages. 

1. Add a modal that opens from a settings icon in the navbar 
2. In the modal, for each language, let the user pick which voice they want 
2.1 for each language like `en` find all voices in `speechSynthesis` that have lang starts with `en` and let user pick from that 
2.2 once lang is picked, attach that voice to the language objet 
3. when speaking, pick the voice that is attached to the selected language

This should not be in LanguageSelector.vue but in a separate modal.

Hi,

I tried to add force merge option that converts type (and respects general master preferences) in merging (fix #103 ).

Adds 3 options -- skip, always convert, ask  

Some things to take care of before merging the PR:
~~1. The dialog box visuals can be improved~~ (This is now fixed)
2. Bulk merging with convert set to true needs to be re-run multiple times on varying length of mismatched duplicate files for testing. It needs enough time to save transaction, or I get error saying - cannot change type in loadIn mode. I verified it with 150/300 duplicates, and that worked.
3. Linting. The `npm run lint` command was changing too many files and I was worried about messing something up.

Admittedly, I had used GitHub Copilot to pick the triggers for the Download test workflow. However, it turns out that running on `pull_request_target` is useless, since the download test will only be run on the release PRs from `dev` to `main.` and a released pipeline should have passed that test before. 

Additionally, I am removing the `edited` web hook, since editing the text of the PR description is not really a useful trigger for testing the download.

This pull request introduces the implementation of the standard k-ε turbulence model with the standard wall function in the ESPH framework. The implementation is verified against a 2D turbulent channel flow case at a Reynolds number of 20,000. Additionally, the PR ensures naming consistency by renaming a test case.

1. Standard k-ε Turbulence Model Implementation:
The standard k-ε transport equations are implemented along with a standard wall function for turbulence modeling.

Files: turbulence_model.h, turbulence_model.cpp, and turbulence_model.hpp:
- Definition and implementation of k-ε transport equations.
- Implementation of the standard wall function, wall-adjacent cell identification.

2. HLLC Riemann Solver for Turbulence Variables:
Extends the Eulerian HLLC Riemann solver to handle the advection terms for turbulence variables (k and ε).

Files: extended_eulerian_riemann_solver.h and extended_eulerian_riemann_solver.cpp:
- Extends the HLLC Riemann solver to compute interface states for TKE and dissipation variables.

3. Turbulence Forces for RANS Momentum Equation:
Implements the turbulence forces necessary for the RANS momentum equation: 

- TKE Gradient Force.
- Turbulent Viscous Force.

Files: rans_turbulence_dynamics.h and rans_turbulence_dynamics.hpp:
- Implements turbulence force calculations for incompressible/weakly compressible flows.

4. Test Case: test_2d_FVM_turbulent_channelflow:
The test_2d_FVM_turbulent_channelflow test case is developed to verify the turbulence model implementation:

Verification Details:
- Reynolds number: 20,000.
- Verification against Fluent results.

5. Updates to the test_3d_incompressible_channel_flow case:

- Naming Consistency: The test case test_3d_incompressible_channel_flow is renamed to test_3d_FVM_incompressible_channel_flow to align with the naming conventions for FVM test cases.
- Rearrangement: To avoid double registration of the variables, some part of the code is rearranged
- Initialization: Mass and momentum variables initializaton is added, which results in reduction in simulation time.

copilot generated summary:

This pull request includes several changes to improve the fluid dynamics simulations and refactor the test files for better organization and functionality. The changes focus on adding turbulence models, refactoring test files, and minor code cleanups.

## Why?

This drastically improves the quality of GitHub Copilot's suggestions when generating tests.

## How?

I added a Markdown file with instructions and mentioned that file in the `.vscode/settings.json` file

## Testing?

This PR modernizes the project by transitioning from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml` for configuration, improving compatibility with modern Python packaging standards.

The `final0` model has also been published on the Hugging Face Hub as [`safe-models/beat-this-final0`](https://huggingface.co/safe-models/beat-this-final0/tree/main?show_file_info=model.safetensors), stored in safetensors FP16 format since all tensor values are within range. This optimization reduces the model size by approximately 50%, bringing it down to ~40MB while maintaining performance. Additionally, the download speed is faster now, thanks to Hugging Face's optimized networking.

```py
file2beats = File2Beats(checkpoint_path=""safe-models/beat-this-final0"", device=""cpu"", dbn=False)

<blockquote>
<h1>8.1.0</h1>
<h2>New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To support certain Federation identity cases, you need to add an additional parameter called <code>TokenExchangeAuthority</code>. This parameter is necessary when the issuer (the entity that issues the token) for the token exchange URL is different from the application's issuer. See <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-abstractions-for-dotnet/issues/155"">#155</a> for details.</li>
<li>Added a new interface <code>ICustomSignedAssertionProvider</code> for implementing custom signed assertion providers. This interface includes a <code>Name</code> property for configuration-friendly naming. See issue <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-abstractions-for-dotnet/issues/153"">#153</a> for details.</li>
<li>Added extensibility to the <code>CredentialDescription</code> class to support custom signed assertion providers. This includes new properties <code>CustomSignedAssertionProviderName</code> and <code>CustomSignedAssertionProviderData</code>. See issue <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-abstractions-for-dotnet/issues/146"">#146</a> for details.</li>
