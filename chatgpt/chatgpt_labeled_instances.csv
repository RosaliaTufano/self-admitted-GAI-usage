Realized I didn't add the correct handling for where the repo is cloned from, I was supposed to add my own info in there, haha.

Not gonna lie, I've been using ChatGPT to help me out with learning these new tools, as they seem to be more confusing for me to understand than coding sometimes, geeez man. I see how they can speed things up, but they definitely take a while to fully dive into using in your own coding setup. Once you get on board though, it really is another level of cool. You just have to take that first leap! I guess I'm trying to do that with ChatGPT too, and it has shown itself to be very helpful to me already so far. I think my favorite thing about it is it's understanding in context for things you are asking it. It's less about keywords, and more about providing it with real context that it can break down and try to understand what you're trying to do. That's a really big thing to be able to break down. My thought about it is that it's still the same data that we're working with already (everything on the Internet), but it's a much more refined interface to be able to look at it through. The data's already out there, and now we have another tool to be able to look though, compare, and discern what we already know and have learned (as people, I guess I'd say). Of course the data on the Internet doesn't perfectly depict all of the information out in the world, but that's not ChatGPT's issue, that's because of what we've all decided to put up on the Internet in the first place. It also could be ChatGPT's fault for both parsing that Big-Data inaccurately, so I guess it's a bit 'lossless' on both sides, at least to how I'm thinking of it. If we as people can discern what we get out of our conversations with projects like ChatGPT, we can then *ourselves* also get the big picture from what it responds, since that's exactly what it's (GPT) doing also. I think this makes it ""reliable-ish"" in a way. I think navigating Wikipedia this way is also very smart. For how much data there is on a given resource you're looking at, I'd like to think that some majority of it is most likely credible. If you understand and accept that you don't know for sure though, than you can got to multiple different resources to try and see what each one represents. Then you yourself can decide how you want to take those conclusions.

Not sure what that rant was, or where that came from. That was awesome! XD"

shows what PHPCS would consider correct after a pass of phpcbf. This can

Improves accuracy of PolygonPolygonClosestLine and ClosestLine functions. Big disclaimer, I heavily relied on ChatGPT for the math logic here... extra eyes greatly appreciated. I myself plan to do a deeper review on the math here before merging.

Before:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0d9d5d5-76e9-4e05-8459-15b6a48b0dcb

After:


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85d4410b-2bf2-4f51-90e2-4ee828a9693b


I also think there's a faster way to do the `PolygonPolygonClosestLine` logic. Right now it iterates over each side of the polygon, draws a line, and returns the shortest result. Potentially it could use SAT to determine the closest sides, but I had unexpected results

```ts
PolygonPolygonClosestLine(polygonA: PolygonCollider, polygonB: PolygonCollider) {
    const aSat = SeparatingAxis.findPolygonPolygonSeparation(polygonA, polygonB);
    const bSat = SeparatingAxis.findPolygonPolygonSeparation(polygonB, polygonA);

    return ClosestLine2(aSat.side, bSat.side);
}
```

Hi @SNNafi , first of all thank you for your work on this package!

If you can, could you please help me sort out what I should do given the following circumstances? I have read all the official docs, searched on StackOverflow and asked ChatGPT in all kind of ways but it's still unclear for me what should be done to **migrate existing video files created by my app to the `Movies` directory**.

My [open source video diary](https://github.com/KyleKun/one_second_diary) update got rejected by Google because they won't allow the manage all files permission, which I was using to avoid such issues on Android 13. The published version of my app created a directory in the root path (Internal Storage > MyAppFolder) and saved videos there. The sdk target in manifest is `targetSdkVersion 29`.

From what I have seen in the [migration docs](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/use-cases#migrate-legacy-storage), I should keep the `targetSdkVersion 29`, keep the `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage=""true""` and then move the files and delete this original folder. Then after all users updated and migrated the files, I should target a newer sdk and keep saving files there (I think the `Movies` folder makes more sense).

This file moving process should be done with your package in order to register them in the MediaStore API? Will this work for any Android version or should I do different things for Android 10 and lower? I would like to preserve these files even if the user unninstalls the app, so I want to be able to still have access to them after a reinstall. And after the migration is complete, should I use your package to write the files?

I will be extremely grateful if you could clarify these points, my app is ready to update with plenty new features and this is the last thing holding me back. Thanks so much!

76,679a7a2ecbe8284d7a71c86f,issue,learning -> how to use a library/framework/tool -> generating code examples,https://github.com/PenguLoader/PenguLoader/issues/10,"Can you help me detecting when connecting to lobby ?
Hey,

First of all thank you for this tool it's very useful.

I want to detect when I'm connecting to the chat in champ-select. I don't have much knowledge, but I found a few things on the internet and they work for everything but what I want.

I am trying to use MutationObserver API to detect when an element of class `chat-message` is created, so upon arriving in the champ-select I run this in the console : 
```js
function listenForChatMessages() {
  var targetNode = document.getElementById('chat-messages-frame').contentDocument.body;
  var config = { attributes: true, childList: true, subtree: true };
  var callback = function(mutationsList) {
    for(var mutation of mutationsList) {
        console.log(mutation)
      if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
        var newNodes = mutation.addedNodes;
        for (var i = 0; i < newNodes.length; i++) {
          var node = newNodes[i];
          if (node.classList && node.classList.contains('chat-message')) {
            //Do something here
            console.log(""New chat message element detected!"");
          }
        }
      }
    }
  };
  var observer = new MutationObserver(callback);
  observer.observe(targetNode, config);
}
```

And then I send a message to see if it caught it, and it didn't.
I tried using the MutationObserver in league-loader for capturing other things and it did work, here specifically it won't.

I hoped you could help me, not necessarily using MutationObserver, but anything that can detect when I'm connected to the chat in champ-select will do.

The code example is just one of about ten other ways I tried to do it but that didn't work, I'm running out of ideas. I even tried using ChatGPT to generate code, and it did, and again it worked for everything but for the chat messages :(

Thank you !"
77,679a7af8cbe8284d7a71c8da,issue,software quality -> refactoring,https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/R3BRoot/issues/763,"Replacing char* with std::string
For most array types, std::vector, std::array and boost::multi_array provide drop in replacements. You just change the definition and all the rest keeps working as before. 

For NUL terminated character arrays (which are virtually all character arrays), which are used to store strings, things are more difficult. The correct replacement here would be std::string, which has different semantics. 

Just for fun, I have asked chatGPT ""rewrite the following using std::string instead of char*: ([code of R3BGeoCave::read](https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/R3BRoot/blob/master/passive/R3BGeoCave.cxx#L38))""

Like most GPT output, it looks plausible at a first glance. Of course, the devil is in the details. TString(buf) works, while FairGeoMedia::getMedium() has no variant taking a std::string, so one would have to use c_str() there, I guess. 

I think we should only try to fix C strings after we have fixed the other uses of C arrays. 

Edit: it also does a somewhat reasonable job on ""in the following code, please replace all 1d C arrays with std::array and all multi-dimensional arrays with boost::multi_array."" It does convert a plain pointer to an ``std::array<int, 1>``, which is wrong."

### Description

One of the weakest points of Maxi it's the fact that we need to load editor side and save the content to have styles. Some situations where this can affect us is:
1. When migrate a site
2. When we directly copy code to `code editor` without rendering the blocks
3. When we install Maxi Theme (or any other theme in future)
4. Probably there are many other situations...

It's a known issue we've been carrying waiting for fixing it in future, and I think there are at least 3 reasons why now is the moment:
1. We are about to release beta, which means we are closer to be opened to the public.
2. We have FSE support and Maxi Theme.
3. We can use chatGPT (❤️ )

The main idea is: when loading a page, if the styles doesn't exist on Maxi DB, create them and save on the DB, so next time we'll require them from there again.

### Other plugins or websites examples

### How to implement it

I've been doing a prototype to check the viability of the feature and how hard it can be. Our best chance is to use chatGPT (I didn't like the way copilot did the transform) to transform our current JS functions to PHP. The prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/maxi-blocks/maxi-blocks/tree/frontend-styles-loader). This prototype it's a base to start working on, but has been modified to force the load of styles from the frontend loader and not the DB. To test it you can use this [code editor](https://github.com/maxi-blocks/maxi-blocks/files/10765707/frontendloader.txt) that will render a Group Maxi affected by some margin styles generated on frontend and not coming from DB. 
The prototype currently implements:
1. New method `get_styles_from_blocks` on `MaxiBlocks_Styles` that iterates over the blocks to get the styles.
2. New class `MaxiBlocks_Group_Block` as possible example of a block class to get the styles, similar to `styles.js` of each block folder.
3. New `utils` coming from JS side like `get_last_breakpoint_attribute` or `get_group_attributes`. It also contains all the JS side functions to create the styles strings, with same workflow and names.
4. Translated `helper` for margin-padding.

To create it, I've been using chatGPT to translate these functions from JS to PHP, and the result is awesomely fast. They normally need some small details, but it's going to 🚀  the implementation of it. So, tasks we need to do to fix this:
1. Create a class for each block as `MaxiBlocks_Group_Block`. It needs an improvement with the way it gets the `$data` values, as it should get directly from the block `data.js` file; and obviously, it needs to be fulfilled with the rest of content to create correct styles 👍 
2. Translate all styles helpers.
3. A better way to access to `$defaults` on `get_group_attributes` to keep them always update.
4. Generate the necessary logics to check if the styles aren't saved on DB, to create them and then save to be used in future.
5. Clean code and ensure better and cleaner 'requires'. It can be a good idea to think on other organization than the one of the prototype: maybe in classes, not sure. The current organization of the prototype looks dirty to me 👍 

Probably we'll face some issues with contexts (like `rowProps` used on Column Maxi) and things like this; once arrived in that point we can check together how to deal with that situations 👍

My use-case is pretty simple: 

1. List files under a selected folder.
2. Listen for any changes over this folder (deletion, renaming, creation, etc.). So, for instance, even if the user deletes a child file `A` using a third-party app (e.g the OS file manager) my app will be able to catch the event and delete the file reference, to avoid ghost files in my recycler view.

To list the files under a selected folder, which is a simple tree URI that my app gains access through `openDocumentTree`, I'm already using SAF, I can use the tree URI to delete, rename, move child documents, etc. so permission is not a problem here.

But I am not able to find any resource pointing to some way to do the ""listening"" part. I've already:

- Read the Google storage documentation, but they cover every edge-case but not this one https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data.
- I tried to see an example of it on the [android/storage-samples](https://github.com/android/storage-samples) repository but even there they are just reloading the entire directory when the user renames a folder, and it is not handling when the user does the alter by a third-party app, [android/storage-samples/blob/22784d8cbf1d990958ae554ec61afea1a9da93c1](https://github.com/android/storage-samples/blob/22784d8cbf1d990958ae554ec61afea1a9da93c1/ActionOpenDocumentTree/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/ktfiles/DirectoryFragment.kt#L133).
- https://github.com/K1rakishou/Fuck-Storage-Access-Framework library, no mention to any kind of listenable APIs.
- https://github.com/anggrayudi/SimpleStorage (this library), no mention to any kind of listenable APIs.
- https://github.com/google/modernstorage, same...
- I even asked ChatGPT but he brings me a solution that doesn't works, the `ContentResolver.registerContentObserver`, which is exactly the approach of some unanswered SO questions (see below).

I found and tried some SO questions about it (a bit 'older' ~ 3 years), which also doesn't have answers yet:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60796380/storage-access-framework-register-content-observer.
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75180057/register-content-observer-on-external-storage.

My question is, do we have access to something that allow us to listen for changes over a folder that we've permission over?

I'm just about to give-up this shit and add `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission and use the [FileObserver API](https://gist.github.com/gitanuj/888ef7592be1d3f617f6), and if it does not work either I think I'll just start brute-forcing the user storage searching for changes foff <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51419598/220283630-5184d2e6-b838-4821-a831-cc864ab3c0f5.gif"">.

Given this plugin's current functionality, I am curious if it would be possible to expand the option of opening ChatGPT's responses in a .txt file to also save these responses as an iterative log of both user prompts and GPT's responses (saved locally)?

For example, I've just asked ChatGPT the following: 
> ai how can I write code that will generate a .txt file with a saved record of our conversation together? ||

ChatGPT's response: 
> To generate a .txt file with a saved record of our conversation, you can use the following Python code:
> 
> ```
> # Open a new file in write mode
> with open('conversation.txt', 'w') as file:
>    # Write the conversation to the file
>    file.write('Here is a record of our conversation:\n')
>    for message in messages: # messages is a list of our conversation
>       file.write(message + '\n')
> print('Conversation saved in conversation.txt')
> ```
> 
> In this code, we first open a new file called ""conversation.txt"" in write mode. Using the `with` statement ensures that the file is closed properly after it's done being written to. 
> 
> Inside the `with` block, we write a header to the file indicating that it's a record of our conversation. Then, we iterate over each message in the `messages` list (which would contain all the messages in our conversation) and write each one to a new line in the file.
> 
> Finally, we print a message indicating that the conversation has been saved in the file.
> 
> Make sure to replace the `messages` list with the actual list of messages that you want to save.

I don't have the understanding to implement this as a request, but wanted to leave this as a topic for consideration. Storing a local record of both prompts and the responses would be especially helpful when GPT is overloaded, or chat history is not saved displaying correctly on OpenAI's website.

> First of all I'm sorry to open an issue in your GitHub repository! I really appreciate the tool you created and thank you for the work.

## Main question

I was wondering if there is a way to parse markdown with this tool and give the attribute `className` instead of the regular `class` when using a comment like:

```markdown
Some paragraph of my markdown file...
<!--rehype:className=regularText-->
```

The problem with this is that if I render things as `.use(rehypeAttr, { properties: 'attr' })`, this gives a translation that adds `class` to the resulting `<p>` instead of `className`. I'm asking this in the hope that something already exists, but if not I'd be happy to collaborate on some code for the implementation.

## Another question

I was using ChatGPT to help me fix this, and it suggested a syntax similar to this:

```js
.use(rehypeAttr, {
      p: { className: 'text-gray-700 my-10' },
      h1: { className: 'text-3xl font-bold' },
})

I asked ChatGPT for an answer:

 * how do i truncate tables with foreign keys using pgantomizer?
 * To truncate tables with foreign keys using pgantomizer, you can use the cascade_truncate function provided by the tool. The cascade_truncate function will automatically disable or drop the foreign key constraints, truncate the table, and then re-enable or recreate the foreign key constraints.

It would be great if that were actually true"

Some possible suggestions to make this project better are:

1.Use a context manager or a try-finally block to ensure that the sockets are closed properly, even if an exception occurs. This will prevent resource leaks and errors. For example:
with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    # do something with s

2.Use logging instead of print statements to record the events and errors in the socket communication. This will make it easier to debug and monitor the program. For example:
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info('os is linux')

3.Use argparse or a configuration file to store and parse the constants, such as listen_PORT, Cloudflare_IP, num_fragment, etc. This will make it easier to change and customize the parameters without modifying the code. For example:
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--port', type=int, default=2500, help='listening port')
args = parser.parse_args()
listen_PORT = args.port

4.Use comments and docstrings to document the purpose and functionality of the code. This will make it easier to understand and maintain the code. For example:
def listen(self):
    """"""Listen for incoming connections and spawn a thread for each one.""""""
    self.sock.listen(128)  # up to 128 concurrent unaccepted socket queued , the more is refused untill accepting those.
    while True:
        client_sock , client_addr = self.sock.accept()                    
        client_sock.settimeout(my_socket_timeout)
        # create a new thread to handle the client connection
        threading.Thread(target=self.handle_client, args=(client_sock, client_addr)).start()"

**Describe the rationale for the suggested feature.**

I'd like to be able to include logic around ""available"" resources on a node in when writing analyzers that deal with node resources. This will help me close in on whether my Kubernetes will be able to schedule my pod before I attempt my install, assuming I align my check with my resource requests.

**Describe the feature**

With this feature implemented, I'd be able to write a preflight that looks like this:

```
        - nodeResources:
            checkName: Are sufficient CPU resources available in the cluster
            outcomes:
              - fail:
                  when: ""min(cpuAvailable) < 250m""
                  message: Your cluster currently has too few CPU resources available to install Gitea
              - pass:
                  message: Your cluster has sufficient CPU resources available to install Gitea
        - nodeResources:
            checkName: Is sufficient memory available in the cluster
            outcomes:
              - fail:
                  when: ""min(memoryAvailable) < 256Mi"" 
                  message: Your cluster currently has too little memory available to install Gitea
              - pass:
                  message: Your cluster has sufficient memory available to install Gitea
 ```    

and fail the install if my resource requests could not be fulfilled on any node (or any node that I've filtered into my analyzer).

`kubectl describe node` provides insight into these values, but they are not available as part of the `status` of the node so just getting the node doesn't show them.


**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Describe alternative solutions here. Include any workarounds you've considered.

**Additional context**

It seems like the best way to handle this is to collect all the resource requests for the pods running on the node and subtract that from the allocatable resources on that node. Based on the order of the `kubectl describe node` output I'd bet that's what it is doing, though I haven't read through the code to check. 

I also asked ChatGPT to write me a `kubectl` plugin to calculate this to see what the code might look like, I'm attaching it for fun and reference.

Generated from ChatGPT :-)

When naming Java packages, it is generally recommended to use singular names rather than plural names. The reason is that a package represents a namespace that contains related classes, interfaces, and resources. Each package represents a distinct unit of organization and encapsulation.

Using singular names for packages helps to maintain consistency with the naming conventions used in Java, where classes and interfaces are typically named using singular nouns to represent individual entities or concepts.

For example, if you have a package that contains classes related to mathematical operations, it would be more appropriate to name it `operation` rather than `operations`. 

Using singular names for packages improves readability and makes the codebase more intuitive to understand. It also aligns with established naming conventions in the Java ecosystem. However, keep in mind that naming conventions can vary across different projects or organizations, so it's important to follow the conventions used within your specific context if they differ from the general recommendations."

### Current Behaviour?

When training a model on my Mac Studio, from time to time it seems that the training freezes, and an epoch takes much more time than usual, from x10 to x200.
I have tried contacting Apple's support, and they are clueless about this phenomena.
I also went through recent Mac related issues in this repository and found nothing relevant.

Here is an example of the phenomena as seen in the training's output:
```

```





### Standalone code to reproduce the issue

```shell
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate random training data
np.random.seed(0)
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y_train = 3 * x_train + 2 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1000, batch_size=10)
```

(Thank ChatGPT for the minimal working example)

### Search before asking

- [X] I have searched the YOLOv5 [issues](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/discussions) and found no similar questions.


### Question

I have always wondered if we should not use letterbox at training time, but only at inference time. I asked ChatGPt why you don't use letterbox for training, and it gave me the following answer:

> During training, letterbox is not used mainly because:

> 1.  Resizing the image can destroy the aspect ratio of the original image, which is not desirable in many tasks. Retaining the aspect ratio of the original image can better train the model, making it suitable for various image sizes and ratios.
> 2.  Resizing the image can distort the image, resulting in a decrease in the quality of training data and adversely affecting model training. In addition, there is no fixed input size during training. Instead, data augmentation techniques, such as random scaling and flipping, can be used to increase the diversity and generalization ability of training data.
> 3.  Resizing the image can also slow down the training speed since the images in each batch need to be resized. Avoiding resizing can reduce training time and computing costs.
Therefore, during training, letterbox is not used for resizing, and other data augmentation techniques are used instead. Letterbox is used to resize the image during inference to facilitate the uniform input size and detect objects in images of any size.

Is it right?

### Description

Please, can you add Custom Loss Function feature?
So anyone can build and use their own loss function.

I asked ChatGPT to make a Number Signal (positive/negative) Mean Accuracy loss function for Pytorch.
Predicting financial/stocks time series is more about the correct Direction (up/down) than point accuracy (RMSE).
Predicting Stocks time series we use returns (t, t-1 difference) to make it stationary and predict if next difference is positive/negative (up/down movement).

If NeuralForecast accept custom loss function, I would use the script suggested by ChatGPT (not tested yet):

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    class NumberSignalLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NumberSignalLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        predictions = torch.sign(predictions)  # Convert predictions to either -1 or 1
        targets = torch.sign(targets)  # Convert targets to either -1 or 1

        accuracy = torch.mean(torch.eq(predictions, targets).float())  # Compute mean accuracy

        loss = 1 - accuracy  # Calculate loss as 1 - accuracy

        return loss


ChatGPT said:
In this example, the NumberSignalLoss class is a subclass of nn.Module that implements the loss function. The forward method takes in two inputs: predictions and targets. Both inputs are assumed to be tensors.

The forward method first applies the torch.sign function to both the predictions and targets. This function converts positive values to 1 and negative values to -1, making the predictions and targets binary signals.

Then, it calculates the accuracy by comparing the element-wise equality of the predictions and targets using torch.eq. The result is then converted to a float tensor and the mean is taken using torch.mean.

Finally, the loss is calculated as 1 - accuracy since we want to minimize the loss. The loss tensor is returned as the output.

You can use this loss function in your PyTorch training loop by instantiating an instance of NumberSignalLoss and passing your predictions and targets to it. The resulting loss can then be used for backpropagation and optimization.

I'm using this plugin with [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/). Quasar can build Capacitor apps for both iOS and Android. I have it working perfectly fine in iOS. I'm just having trouble getting it to work within the Android build.

I use Quasar to build for Android app: `quasar build -m capacitor -T android` 

I then get the following error:

```

```

I've tried multiple iterations of changes:
- Downgrading `capacitor-plugin-glassfy` to `3.0.0`
- Adding Kotlin version into `capacitor.build.gradle` file
-  Adding Kotlin version into the parent `build.gradle` file
- Asking ChatGPT for input but I keep going in loops with adding a snippet for Kotlin version but it doesn't work
- Asking Bard for input hasn't cracked it either

Nothing seems to work - except removing `capacitor-plugin-glassfy` from the capacitor `package.json` of course - which is not what I want to do.

Here's my Capacitor dependencies for reference: 
```

```
android {
  compileOptions {
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17

  }

```

Would love any direction to get the Android built to work with the `capacitor-plugin-glassfy` reference in the `package.json` - As I assume that's the ideal scenario.

I've been trying to compile box86 on arch for the past few days with no success. Well, just a little. I managed to get it compiled for armhf, but not for aarch64.

I'm compiling this on a qemu aarch64 virtual machine.

For armhf compilation I installed `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` and `arm-linux-gnueabihf-glibc`. For arm64, I didn't find any packages, so I downloaded some from [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-a) (specifically `gcc-arm-10.3-2021.07-aarch64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz`).

Then I ran `export CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` and `export CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++` to specify what compilers it's supposed to use. The build worked and it works on armhf. When I tried to run it on the vm (aarch64), it says `cannot execute binary file`. I asked chatgpt how to cross compile and it said I should type in `export CC_ARM64=/path/to/toolchain/aarch64-none-elf-gcc` and `export CXX_ARM64=/path/to/toolchain/aarch64-none-elf-g++` and add `CFLAGS=""-march=aarch64"" CXXFLAGS=""-march=aarch64""` to the make command. I ran it again and it seemed that nothing has changed. And yes, I still can't run it on aarch64.

Also, adding `-DARM64=1` to cmake doesn't work.

Hi,

i used displayfusion before. 
But since this ruined some games with the last update on my ultrawide i now use fancyzones, i am just missing one thing.

Sometimes i have windows which are not snapped or maximized. 
Then i double click them in the are i want them to get snapped (mostly in the middle, my zones are 1600 | 1920 | 1600 wide).
But then the window gets maximized over the entire screen.

I asked ChatGPT to give me a solution to hope i was blind.
It gave me ""Make maximized windows 'snap' to this zone"" but i could not find this option and also were not able to find it anywhere else. 

Am i missing something?

I am not using the predefined zones in the maximize buttons, i deactivated them to be honest.

The buttons in the Grafana dashboard (https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13768-blocky/) did not work for me. After I allowed JavaScript in Grafana and fixed the URL, it still popped up an error message. The network requests went to the correct API endpoint, and the /blocking/status endpoint reported that the commands had reached the blocky server. So the only problem seems to be in the UI. The issue seems to be that the endpoint `/api/blocking/disable?duration=300s` return an empty string whereas the `$.get` expects it to return a valid JavaScript object and therefore the get request fails by parse errors.

With the help of ChatGPT for debugging, I came up with the workaround to change out the 

```
$.get(url + '/api/blocking/'+op, function(data) {
    showAlert()
  })
```

to

```
 $.ajax({

https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf

### Background

In the section on the third step of the process, it is written:

- What multiple organizations seem to have gotten to work is **fine-tuning some or all of the parameters of a copy of the initial LM** with a policy-gradient RL algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 
- **Parameters of the LM are frozen because fine-tuning** an entire 10B or 100B+ parameter model **is prohibitively expensive**
   ...
- First, **the policy is a language model** that takes in a prompt and returns a sequence of text (or just probability distributions over text)

I'm confused, because based on this information:

- Fine-tuning an entire model is prohibitively expensive.
- Yet, the policy for the RL fine-tuning is the language model, which is a copy of the original LM
- Fine-tuning of which is prohibitively expensive

I may not understand this fully, but my current logic leads me to think that these statements are contradicting.

I tried to research the RL fine-tuning process a bit and asked ChatGPT to brainstorm with me about this contradiction. From what I've gathered the parameters of the original LM are frozen not because it is prohibitively expensive (as we're doing that anyway with the copy), but because:

- It allows the retention and leverage of valuable knowledge and language understanding acquired during pretraining of original LM, while making targeted adjustments to align the copy of the model with specific objectives or human preferences. This would also correlate with what is written later in the article about the KL divergence.
- It allows researchers to explore different fine-tuning approaches without modifying the original LM, enabling greater control and experimentation.

Hence, is the following a correct reasoning on freezing during fine-tuning?

- We freeze all of the original LM parameters - for these two aforementioned reasons
- We freeze some of the copy of the LM parameters - because it's expensive to fine-tune all of them 

This way, the statement about 'fine-tuning an entire 10B or 100B+ parameter model is prohibitively expensive' would be coherent with the rest of the information provided.

### Suggestions

If that reasoning is correct, then I think this sentence:

> fine-tuning some or all of the parameters of a copy of the initial LM

Would probably make more sense if it didn't state _'or all'_.

And additionally, the following statement:

> Parameters of the LM are frozen because fine-tuning an entire 10B or 100B+ parameter model is prohibitively expensive

Would make more sense if it started with _'Some parameters of the copy of the LM...'_.

And potentially I'd suggest adding an explanation regarding the original LM freezing, along the lines of:

> Parameters of the original LM are frozen in order to retain the valuable knowledge and language understanding acquired during pretraining, while making targeted adjustments to align the copy of the LM with specific objectives or human preferences

If there's something I'm missing here, please accept my apology for these suggestions and let me know what I got wrong."

So I was trying to use addVideoChunkRaw method and use data from VideoEncoder.  Again it seems like some problem with raw avc data. When I add there complete frame, it's playable in Chrome but not in Quicktime - mp4 seems to be broken.
So I tried to use ChatGPT to get some help with avc codec parsing (as previously helped me with aac) but I'm not luck for now. When I try to detect header and cut it from ArrayBuffer, video is still not playable.

I understand this time is hard to say why this not work due to third-party library but maybe you can have some tips where problem could be. I have two ideas:

1. AVC codec - header/data splitting - I'm doing it wrong and ChatGPT doesn't give me correct anwsers

2. Description attribute is missing in my muxer -> I noticed that when I use native VideoEncoder, it gives me metadata with description field within keyframe videochunk. When I not pass this metadata to your muxer - especially the description field - muxed video doesn't work correctly.

Thank you for any ideas

Details
```
- [ ] The Kademlia Routing algorithm may be incorrect since I used ChatGPT to write the code. It may need to be re-written and audited.
- [ ] `get` requests block the GUI client app. 
    - put requests are simple and don't really affect the local GUI client as much since the local node (which exists on the server side) is sending data to the other nodes in the network, but get requests are expensive and so slow because the data being fetched will be used by and displayed via the GUI client. Is there any way to resolve this issue?
    - perhaps the `recv` timeout should be shorten to miliseconds rather than seconds?
    - `get_provider` request was made to make it easier to fetch data directly from the peers that have the data in their hash tables.
    - Should the default (hard-coded) bootstrap nodes be allowed to accept `map` requests in order to maintain a complete list of all keys and their providers?
    
        tl;rl: searching for a key in the DHT network can take forever which will probably block the GUI client app.
- [ ] Proper memory management and ensure thread safety, especially in `node.cpp` and `routing_table.cpp`, `msgpack.cpp`, and `daemon/main.cpp`.

Hello Smartstore team,

I've encountered an issue in the Smartstore 5.0.5 admin panel, specifically in the `/admin/module/list` section. This issue affects admins who are uploading new plugins (or ""modules"").

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/module/list`.
2. Upload a new plugin.
3. Observe the green notification at the bottom left that says: ""Package xxx has been uploaded and successfully unpacked. Please reload the list."" (see screenshot with highlighted notification below)

The expected behavior for most web users would be to refresh the browser page using F5 to see the newly uploaded plugin in the plugin list. However, this action doesn't refresh the list as expected.

Instead, to see the newly uploaded plugin, one has to click on the grey button at the top right and select ""Reload List"".

**Suggested Solutions:**
1. Modify the notification text to explicitly instruct users to click on the ""Reload List"" button.
2. Alternatively, adjust the mechanism so that a browser page reload (F5) also refreshes the plugin list.

Here's a suggested revised notification text that provides clearer instructions to the user:

""Package xxx has been uploaded and successfully unpacked. To view it in the list, please click the 'Edit/Reload List' button at the top right."" This text offers a clear option for the user to see the updated list, making it more user-friendly and reducing potential confusion.

This would enhance the user experience and make the process more intuitive for admins.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to a resolution.

Best regards,
Stefan

Implementation suggestion from ChatGPT :)

=========================================================

To achieve your goal of running the AppVeyor project build on a schedule (every 24 hours), but only if there were any repository changes (commits) in the last 24 hours, you'll need to use a combination of scheduled builds and conditional checks in your `appveyor.yml` configuration file. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Scheduled Build Configuration:**
   Set up a scheduled build that runs every 24 hours. You can do this by using the `schedule` configuration in your `appveyor.yml` file.

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: ""0 */24 * * *""
```

This configuration will trigger a build every 24 hours at the start of the hour (e.g., 00:00, 01:00, etc.).

2. **Conditional Check for Repository Changes:**
   To check whether there were any repository changes (commits) in the last 24 hours before triggering the build, you'll need to use the `git` command within the `before_build` or `init` section of your `appveyor.yml` file.

```yaml
init:
  - ps: |
      $lastCommitDate = git log -1 --format=%ci
      $currentDate = Get-Date -Format ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""
      $timeDiff = New-TimeSpan -Start $lastCommitDate -End $currentDate
      if ($timeDiff.TotalHours -lt 24) {
        Write-Host ""Changes detected in the last 24 hours. Proceeding with the build.""
      }
      else {
        Write-Host ""No changes in the last 24 hours. Skipping the build.""
        Exit-AppVeyorBuild
      }
```

In this example, the script calculates the time difference between the last commit's timestamp and the current time. If the time difference is less than 24 hours, the build proceeds. Otherwise, the script exits the build.

3. **Rest of Your Build Configuration:**
   After the conditional check, you can define the rest of your build configuration as needed.

Putting it all together, your `appveyor.yml` might look something like this:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: ""0 */24 * * *""

init:
  - ps: |
      $lastCommitDate = git log -1 --format=%ci
      $currentDate = Get-Date -Format ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""
      $timeDiff = New-TimeSpan -Start $lastCommitDate -End $currentDate
      if ($timeDiff.TotalHours -lt 24) {
        Write-Host ""Changes detected in the last 24 hours. Proceeding with the build.""
      }
      else {
        Write-Host ""No changes in the last 24 hours. Skipping the build.""
        Exit-AppVeyorBuild
      }

# Define the rest of your build configuration here
```

Remember to adjust the paths and commands according to your project's structure and requirements."

From ChatGPT on removing plugin links:

To remove a plugin link from the WordPress admin bar, you can use the `admin_bar_menu` action hook and check for the specific item to remove. Here's an example of how to do it:

```php
// Remove a specific plugin link from the admin bar
function remove_plugin_link_from_admin_bar($wp_admin_bar) {
    // Replace 'plugin-slug' with the actual plugin slug you want to remove
    $plugin_slug = 'plugin-slug';

    // Remove the plugin link
    $wp_admin_bar->remove_node($plugin_slug);
}
add_action('admin_bar_menu', 'remove_plugin_link_from_admin_bar', 999);
```

In this example, replace `'plugin-slug'` with the actual slug of the plugin link you want to remove from the admin bar. The `999` priority ensures that this action is executed after other items have been added to the admin bar.

Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file or your custom plugin's main PHP file. After adding the code, refresh your WordPress admin area to see the changes. The specified plugin link should be removed from the admin bar."

**Issue Description:**

I encountered an issue while using the `pip install LongNet` command to install the LongNet package. When attempting to import a module using `from LongNet.attention import DilatedAttention`, I received the following error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'LongNet'
```
Upon investigating the installation directory of pip packages (`/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages`), I noticed that the actual installation directory for the LongNet library was named as `longnet` (all lowercase).

**Suggested Resolution:**

It appears that there might be a mismatch between the library's name and the installation directory. To resolve this issue, one of the following actions could be taken:

1. Rename the Installation Directory:
   Rename the installation directory from `longnet` to `LongNet` to match the capitalization of the library's name. This would align the installation directory with the expected import statement.

2. Adjust Import Statements:
   Modify the import statements within the library's codebase to use lowercase import paths, matching the installation directory. For example, change `from LongNet.attention import DilatedAttention` to `from longnet.attention import DilatedAttention`.

This error message suggests that while you've structured the command correctly based on the README, the underlying code in lm-evaluation-harness doesn't support or recognize the quantized keyword argument for the HFLM class.

I was hoping to get some help on how to load GPTQ models for evaluation. Thanks in advance for any help.

### Describe the Problem

I have a React Native Expo Project in TypeScript and i want to include ethersJS to implement wallet funcitonality for an ethereum wallet.

first things first. This here is the package.json for my project:

```
{
  ""name"": ""music-player-wallet"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""main"": ""node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"",
  ""scripts"": {

    ""ios"": ""expo start --ios"",
    ""web"": ""expo start --web"",

  },
  ""dependencies"": {

    ""@react-navigation/native-stack"": ""^6.9.16"",
    ""@types/node"": ""^20.8.9"",
    ""ethers"": ""^6.8.0"",
    ""expo"": ""~49.0.13"",
    ""expo-crypto"": ""~12.4.1"",
    ""expo-status-bar"": ""~1.6.0"",
    ""node-libs-react-native"": ""^1.2.1"",
    ""prettier"": ""^3.0.3"",
    ""react"": ""18.2.0"",
    ""react-dom"": ""18.2.0"",

  },
  ""devDependencies"": {

    ""ts-node"": ""^10.9.1"",
    ""typescript"": ""^5.2.2""
  },
  ""private"": true
}
```
this here is my tsconfig.json file:
```
{
  ""extends"": ""expo/tsconfig.base"",
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""strict"": true,
    ""jsx"": ""react-native"",
    ""types"": [""ethers""]
  },
  ""include"": [""**/*.ts"", ""**/*.tsx""],
  ""paths"": {
    ""@/*"": [""src/*""]
  }
}
```
i followed some instructions online already and added a metro.config.js file which looks like this:
```ts
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require(""expo/metro-config"");

// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (moduleName === ""ethers"") {
    return context.resolveRequest(context, ""ethers/lib.esm/index.js"", platform);
  }
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

module.exports = {
  config,
  resolver: {
    extraNodeModules: require(""node-libs-react-native""),
  },
};
```
my babel.config.js file looks like this:
```ts
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [""babel-preset-expo"", ""module:metro-react-native-babel-preset""],
    overrides: [
      {
        test: ""./node_modules/ethers"",
        plugins: [
          ""@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object"",
          ""@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"",
          ""@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods"",
        ],
      },
    ],
  };
};
```
i created a crypto-shim.js file:
```ts
import { getRandomValues as expoCryptoGetRandomValues } from ""expo-crypto"";

class Crypto {
  getRandomValues = expoCryptoGetRandomValues;
}

const webCrypto = typeof crypto !== ""undefined"" ? crypto : new Crypto();

(() => {
  if (typeof crypto === ""undefined"") {
    Object.defineProperty(window, ""crypto"", {
      configurable: true,
      enumerable: true,
      get: () => webCrypto,
    });
  }
})();
```
then with the help of chatGPT i created ethersTypes.ts:
```ts
declare module ""ethers"" {
  interface RandomBytesFunction {
    (length: number): Uint8Array;
  }

  interface ComputeHmacFunction {
    (algo: string, key: Uint8Array, data: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
  }

  interface Pbkdf2Function {
    (
      passwd: Uint8Array,
      salt: Uint8Array,
      iter: number,
      keylen: number,
      algo: string
    ): Uint8Array;
  }

  interface Sha256Function {
    (data: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
  }

  interface Sha512Function {
    (data: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
  }
}
```
included it in a file called ethersUtils.ts which shows the functions that are recommended in the ethersv6 docs:
```ts
import ""./crypto-shim"";
import ""./ethersTypes"";
import ""@ethersproject/shims"";
import { ethers } from ""ethers"";
import crypto from ""react-native-quick-crypto"";

// Register custom cryptographic implementations with ethers
ethers.utils.randomBytes = (length: number) =>
  new Uint8Array(crypto.randomBytes(length));

ethers.utils.computeHmac = (
  algo: string,
  key: Uint8Array,
  data: Uint8Array
) => {
  return new Uint8Array(crypto.createHmac(algo, key).update(data).digest());
};

ethers.utils.pbkdf2 = (
  passwd: Uint8Array,
  salt: Uint8Array,
  iter: number,
  keylen: number,
  algo: string
) => {
  return new Uint8Array(crypto.pbkdf2Sync(passwd, salt, iter, keylen, algo));
};

ethers.utils.sha256 = (data: Uint8Array) => {
  return new Uint8Array(crypto.createHash(""sha256"").update(data).digest());
};

ethers.utils.sha512 = (data: Uint8Array) => {
  return new Uint8Array(crypto.createHash(""sha512"").update(data).digest());
};
```
and last but not least i have a ethers.ts file that should handle Wallet Creation and all the functionality of ethersJS:
```ts
//wallet creation
//key storage
import ""./crypto-shim"";
import ""./ethereumUtils"";
import ""@ethersproject/shims"";
import { ethers } from ""ethers"";

const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
console.log(""Wallet:"", wallet);
```

But it shows this error here: 
![Bildschirmfoto 2023-10-26 um 14 46 18](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/assets/96432557/abbef9ea-5596-4216-bde6-478c79cf4936)

The Same Error occurs on each file when i want to import {ethers} from ""ethers"". Can anyone help please?

134,679af9d4cbe8284d7a727a93,issue,learning -> how to use a library/framework/tool,https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt/issues/1223,"Command ""poetry run python scripts/setup"" on Conda Powershell returns that a module does not exists.
Hello, I am not sure if this is an implementation issue, a windows issue or what, I couldn't find any information online. 

I was following this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFiof0V3nhA

I was able to get to:
```
poetry install --with ui,local
```

So far, so good, I've checked the modules installed in my conda environment: 
```
(privategpt)  ~\privateGPT  > conda list |select-string pydantic*

pydantic                  2.4.2                    pypi_0    pypi
pydantic-core             2.10.1                   pypi_0    pypi
pydantic-extra-types      2.1.0                    pypi_0    pypi
pydantic-settings         2.0.3                    pypi_0    pypi
```

I checked the folder: (...) miniconda3\envs\privategpt\Lib\site-packages\pydantic\v1  
And after all that, when I run the `poetry run python scripts/setup` I get the following error: 
```
> poetry run -vvv python scripts/setup
Using virtualenv: C:\Users\Fran\miniconda3\envs\privategpt
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from pydantic.v1.utils import deep_update, unique_list
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic.v1'
```

I can't make sense of this, I am not sure how is conda setting the environment but I even did: 
```python 
(privategpt)   ~\privateGPT  git:main python

Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
>>> pydantic

<module 'pydantic' from 'C:\\Users\\Fran\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python311\\site-packages\\pydantic\\__init__.cp311-win_amd64.pyd'> 
```

Another approach I had, using ""poetry run python"" alone to get a prompt:
``` python
(privategpt)   ~\privateGPT  git:main poetry run python

Here I then ran ""help()"" and then ""modules pydantic"":

Therefore, is this conda working wrong? 
I understand then that it's loading a pydantic module with the wrong version, basically it's giving zero effs about the conda environment, right?


Now, here's where IDK what is going on, I'm no python dev and packages/modules/environments confuse me. 




Can someone help me here? I'm really lost on what's the issue.

135,679af9d4cbe8284d7a727b12,issue,learning -> how to use a library/framework/tool,https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/issues/1265,"Question: Are there in-depth examples of plugins?
First, I would like to thank you for providing such an amazing library!  I have been using Acorn for 5+ years, now, in my own little part-time project.  I have managed to create very simple plugins to achieve my goals, but now I am trying to do more.  I am using Acorn to generate AST that I use to transpile source into a custom JS runtime for my game engine (KMUD).  I am hoping someone can lead me to some in-depth examples that would help me implement the following:

- The ""easy"" request: A ""DereferencedCallExpression"" token using a custom operator ('->').  My codebase uses ""wrappers"" (a weak reference to an object instance), but in practice this could be an object reference, a wrapper (function that evaluates to an instance), or even a string literal.  The LHS would be an identifier or a literal.  The RHS would be a CallExpression.  Examples:
   - wrapper->eventSendChat('Hello World');
   - ""/daemon/ChatDaemon""->eventSendChat('Hello World');
  
I have stepped through the CallExpression code in a debugger and I think I understand what is going on.  I could override every method in that call stack, but I am hoping there is an easier solution.  I asked ChatGPT to create a custom Acorn plugin and the result was rather amusing:

 I asked ChatGPT to write me a plugin to support a custom '->' call operator and it responded confidently with a code sample with usage.  I pointed out to the AI that the token it was actually using was '=>' arrow pointer and not what I wanted so it said ""yep, yer right"" and rewrote the sample after defining '->'.  I then noticed it was calling a method called match() when parsing and I asked, ""what version of Acorn is this sample written for?""  It says 8.x so I upgrade, but match() still does not exist and I call it out.  ""Oh, sorry, that should be .eat(token)"".  I try again and get a runtime error as '->' is still not recognized.  I call this out and ChatGPT gives up, telling me ""Adding new operators in Acorn is difficult, perhaps you should try Bable
   
- The hard: I would also like to have a '::' scope resolution operator.  I have implemented a mixin pattern that allows for ""multiple inheritance.""  Obviously, ""there can only be one"" super class, but mixins are a nice way to extend a type.  In my codebase, a type is extended and only the first instance of a new symbol/identifier is grafted onto the prototype, but all implementations of the same name are available via a makeshift virtual table.  Currently you can call an unbound mixin implementation using something like: ob->callMixinImpl('getItems', 'MixinClassName'), but that's gross and error-prone.  I would love to support something like ob->MixinClassName::getItems().  Bonus if the solution supports all member expressions (mixins can expose properties).

If anyone knows of meaningful examples that might help me tackle these I would greatly appreciate it.

136,679af9d4cbe8284d7a727c04,issue,software quality -> fixing -> supporting debugging,https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans/issues/456,"Error in t(OO[[rr]]) : object 'unpackedMatrix_transpose' not found
## Describe the bug
I fit a model: `lmer_richness_tot_log <- lme4::lmer(richness_tot_log ~ species * h2o + (1 | bloc),
                                    data = div_species, REML = TRUE)`
Then, I try to obtain the emmeans for this model: `emm_lmer_richness_tot_log <- emmeans::emmeans(lmer_richness_tot_log,
                                              specs = list(pairwise ~ h2o | species),
                                              type = ""response"", adjust = ""tukey"")`
... and R gives me the following error message: `Error in t(OO[[rr]]) : object 'unpackedMatrix_transpose' not found`
The error occurs only for particular models from my R environment. For example this model works: `glmer_richness_patho <- lme4::glmer(richness_rarfy_patho ~ sp * h2o + (1 | bloc),
                                    data = agg_dat_df, family = poisson)` I also tried a `lme4::lmer()` type of model in a different R environment and this model also worked with the  `emmeans::emmeans` function. I searched on the internet and used ChatGPT to try to solve this error, but was unsuccessful so far. I updated all my R packages. Perhaps, this error is connected to the recent update of emmeans? I did not try to downgrade to an older version of emmeans yet.

## To reproduce
[div_species.csv](https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans/files/13370006/div_species.csv)

`lmer_richness_tot_log <- lme4::lmer(richness_tot_log ~ species * h2o + (1 | bloc),
                                    data = div_species, REML = TRUE)`

`emm_lmer_richness_tot_log <- emmeans::emmeans(lmer_richness_tot_log,
                                              specs = list(pairwise ~ h2o | species),
                                              type = ""response"", adjust = ""tukey"")`


## Expected behavior
I expect to see the pairwise comparisons of each species by H2O treatment in the R console when I run the resulting emmeans object.

## Additional context
I run on the operating system Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS (similar to Ubuntu)

## Ground rules

137,679b0423cbe8284d7a727fc8,issue,software quality -> fixing -> functional bugs,https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/5987,"[Bug?]: `yarn constraints` exits with fatal error if `yarn.config.cjs` imports from ESM, unless executed with `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1 yarn constraints`
Hey! Thanks for all your work on Yarn 4. :) I love it so far, and writing constraints in JS is a nice change. I've encountered a bug, but there's a workaround...

-------

### Self-service

- [ ] I'd be willing to implement a fix

### Describe the bug

Running `yarn constraints` throws a fatal error (""`A dynamic import callback was not specified`"") when `yarn.config.cjs` attempts to `import()` code from an ECMAScript Module. This is a bug, because dynamic `import()` should be available in all CommonJS modules (in fact, when you try to `require()` from an ESM, the error message even tells you to switch to `import()`).

However, the script executes successfully when executed with `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1 yarn constraints`. This indicates the bug is likely in the `v8-compile-cache` package (possibly the one referenced in this [open issue from 2020](https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache/issues/30)). However, I have not investigated the root cause. For me, the workaround is fine, and I simply added a script in my `package.json` to set the variable: `""scripts"": { ""check-constraints"": ""DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1 yarn constraints"" }`.

Possibly related: I am using the `node-modules` linker.

### To reproduce

## 1. Create a new Yarn project with `node-modules` linker

First, create a new Yarn project. I've noticed this bug with the `node-modules` linker. I haven't attempted to replicate it with PnP. This is my `.yarnrc.yml`:

```yml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

## 2. Install the `is-exact-version` package

The package I am attempting to import is [`is-exact-version`](https://github.com/jacobq/is-exact-version), which is installed in the `dependencies` of my root workspace. You can reproduce it by installing the same version I have:

```
yarn add -E is-exact-version@2.0.0-beta.1
```

This is what the main export of that package looks like (note that it's using `import` statements):

```bash
# The main export is a .js file
❯ jq -r '.main' node_modules/is-exact-version/package.json
dist/is-exact-version.js

# It's the only exported .js file
❯ ls node_modules/is-exact-version/dist/
is-exact-version.d.ts   is-exact-version.js     is-exact-version.js.map

# It imports from its dependency semver using ESM syntax
❯ head node_modules/is-exact-version/dist/is-exact-version.js
import clean from 'semver/functions/clean.js';
import Range from 'semver/classes/range.js';
let log = function (...args) { };
(async function optionallyLoadDebugLogger() {
    try {

# It's depending on version 7.3.5 of semver
❯ yarn why semver
...
├─ is-exact-version@npm:2.0.0-beta.1
│  └─ semver@npm:7.5.4 (via npm:^7.3.5)
│
├─ is-exact-version@npm:2.0.0-beta.1 [d00d6]
│  └─ semver@npm:7.5.4 (via npm:^7.3.5)
│
```

## 3. Sanity check: `require()` fails, as expected

Put this into `yarn.config.cjs` and run `yarn constraints`:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require(""@yarnpkg/types"");
const { isExactVersion } = require(""is-exact-version"");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  constraints: async (ctx) => {
    ctx.Yarn.dependencies()[0].error(""The script ran successfully, at least"");
    return;
  },
});
```

As expected, we get an error telling us to `import` instead:

```bash
❯ yarn constraints
Internal Error: require() of ES Module /Users/myusername/path-to/my-project/node_modules/is-exact-version/dist/is-exact-version.js from /Users/myusername/path-to/my-project/yarn.config.cjs not supported.
Instead change the require of is-exact-version.js in /Users/myusername/path-to/my-project/yarn.config.cjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.

    at async sk (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:734:11625)
```

## 4. Reproduce the bug: `import()` fails

Try the simplest possible dynamic `import()`:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require(""@yarnpkg/types"");
module.exports = defineConfig({
  constraints: async (ctx) => {
    const thisIsAnEcmaScriptModule = await import(""is-exact-version"");
    ctx.Yarn.dependencies()[0].error(""The script ran successfully, at least"");
    return;
  },
});
```

This fails with error:

```bash
❯ yarn constraints
Type Error: A dynamic import callback was not specified.
    at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:406:5)
    at importModuleDynamicallyCallback (node:internal/modules/esm/utils:144:9)

    at CC.process (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:524:73339)
    at async p0.execute (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:526:1996)
    at async p0.validateAndExecute (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:94:787)
    at async as.run (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:98:3250)
    at async iPt (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:734:11269)
    at async sk (/Users/myusername/.cache/node/corepack/yarn/4.0.1/yarn.js:734:11625)
```

## 4. Reproduce the workaround

Setting `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` resolves the issue and the script runs successfully:

```bash
❯ DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1 yarn constraints
└─ myproject@workspace:.
   └─ The script ran successfully, at least

```

## Appendix: Potential fix that does not work

Given the error about the unresolved callback, I tried wrapping the import safely. This makes no difference - it produces the same error:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require(""@yarnpkg/types"");

function loadIsExactVersion() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    import(""is-exact-version"")
      .then((module) => {
        resolve(module.isExactVersion);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        reject(error);
      });
  });
}

module.exports = defineConfig({
  constraints: async (ctx) => {
    const thisIsAnEcmaScriptModule = await loadIsExactVersion();
    ctx.Yarn.dependencies()[0].error(""The script ran successfully, at least"");
    return;
  },
});

```

### Environment

```shell
❯ yarn dlx -q envinfo --preset jest

  System:
    OS: macOS 13.5
    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1038NG7 CPU @ 2.00GHz
  Binaries:
    Node: 20.9.0 - /private/var/folders/np/djbv9lnn5wd62yrs60zxh_p40000gn/T/xfs-fae2114e/node

    npm: 10.1.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.9.0/bin/npm

```


### Additional context

As mentioned, I am using the `node-modules` linker. 

The only reason I noticed that `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` fixed the bug is because when I was switching back and forth between attempts to fix the script, I would sometimes encounter a different error, ""`invalid host defined options`."" Googling that [led me to `v8-compile-cache`](https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1559619176230047744). There are some recent issues with similar errors in other projects, e.g. https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4267 and https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/issues/3114 (Then I asked ChatGPT if I could opt out of v8-compile-cache, and it told me I could set `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1`, which sounded so convenient I thought it was hallucinating, but it worked!)"

I was trying to use one of the function from _**CommonController**_ in other controller, but I found out that express validator only can work in **_routing_** level. So may i know is this possible to use it in controller which act like routing level to filter request body?
Below provide some samples which generate from ChatGPT but I tested all cannot filter the req.

Wouldn't it be great to show you how a single-threaded, memory-mapped key-value store can be more efficient than a hand-written memory-mapped solution? I faced issues while porting the Spotify disk-based Approximate Nearest Neighbors library to Rust and, more specifically, to LMDB. Those issues were primarily due to LMDB and memory safety. Here is the story.

To remind you, [Arroy is a library](https://github.com/meilisearch/arroy) that stores embeddings (vectors of floats) on disk. Some data structures are generated on top of those vectors, which look like trees governed by normals used to recursively split the vectors dataset into subdomains. But you can read more about this in part 1 of this series.

### How does Annoy Generate the Tree Nodes?

Annoy, the Spotify library stores the nodes on disk, the item nodes (the ones containing the embeddings), and the other nodes that we will call tree nodes in this article. The advantage of doing this is double:
 - The program's memory usage is low and optimized by the OS as all the nodes live in a memory-mapped file.
 - The concept is simple: Access a node by using its ID. The library will find its offset on disk by using a simple multiplication.

However, there are downsides to doing that. All nodes: items with embeddings along with the tree nodes must have the same size, and If a user wants to identify its embedding using the ID 2<sup>31</sup>, the library will increase the file size to the ID multiplied by the node size. For example, with a vector of 768 dimensions, storing a single item with the ID 2<sup>31</sup> will generate a file of more than 6.5 TiB.

In generating the final data structure, the tree nodes are all written to disk in the same file as the user item containing the embeddings. Those tree-building processes run in parallel, one running process by tree, and, therefore, requires a lot of synchronization when defining the newly created node ID and the memory area reserved for it, most importantly, when the memory-mapped file is too small to accept more nodes, only a single thread must grow the file, so a mutex is used on top of the mutable memory-map and around a `node_id` variable. One interesting property of tree generation is that the generation process only requires the original user item with embeddings.

### The Challenges We Encountered when Porting it to LMDB

A fun fact is that it is the first time in a long time that I have written C++, and the first time I asked ChatGPT to code for me because I was not confident in doing C++ and feared falling into some segfault. I needed a small program to deserialize embeddings from stdin and give them to Annoy. The chatbot's code was mostly effective, but it omitted a critical [empty vector check](https://gist.github.com/Kerollmops/d0e434016b1a698ec9bdbd86d268885e#file-par_build_tree-cpp-L74), which led to a segmentation fault...

The main obstacle to porting it to LMDB is that writing into this key-value store is single-threaded. It doesn't support concurrent write operations to maintain a correctly balanced BTree. Fun incoming!

#### Reading the User Item Nodes from Different Threads

We have used LMDB at Meilisearch since the beginning. It is a well-maintained key-value store used in Firefox and maintained by the OpenLDAP developers. It is memory-mapped and does not maintain a user-end cache of the entries in memory but instead gives you a pointer to the memory-mapped area on disk. The main advantage is that you can keep a pointer to this area for as long as your read transaction lives. Ho yeah! Because it is a transactional key-value store that supports atomic committing, too!

But tree generation doesn't require referring to the generated nodes but only the user items. We previously saw that LMDB gives direct pointers into the memory-mapped file without maintaining any intermediate cache (that could be invalidated). There is another quirk with LMDB: you cannot share a read-only transaction between multiple threads, i.e., `RoTxn: !Sync` and you cannot move the write transaction between threads, i.e., `RwTxn: !Send + !Sync`. Ho! And there is no way to create a read-transaction on uncommitted changes. This is an issue because we want to generate the data-structures trees in the same transaction where we store the items.

But magic is everywhere, starting with the following small and fun data structure. The principle is to keep the pointers to the internal user items with embeddings in a `Vec<*const u8>`. Thanks to Rust, we can ensure, at compile time, that the pointers will live long enough by keeping the lifetime in the struct. Using the `&'t RwTxn` to get the `&'t RoTxn` by using `Deref` also ensures that we cannot modify the database while reading in it by using a `&'t mut RwTxn`. [According to the leading developer of LMDB](https://bugs.openldap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10138#c9), it is safe to share those pointers between threads and why I implemented `Sync` for this structure.

```rust
pub struct ImmutableItems<'t, D> {
    item_ids: RoaringBitmap,
    constant_length: Option<usize>,
    offsets: Vec<*const u8>,
    _marker: marker::PhantomData<(&'t (), D)>,
}

impl<'t, D: Distance> ImmutableItems<'t, D> {
    pub fn new(rtxn: &'t RoTxn, database: Database<D>, index: u16) -> heed::Result<Self> {
        let mut item_ids = RoaringBitmap::new();
        let mut constant_length = None;
        let mut offsets = Vec::new();

        for result in database.items()? {
            let (item_id, bytes) = result?;
            assert_eq!(*constant_length.get_or_insert(bytes.len()), bytes.len());
            item_ids.push(item_id);
            offsets.push(bytes.as_ptr());
        }

        Ok(ImmutableItems { item_ids, constant_length, offsets, _marker: marker::PhantomData })
    }

    pub fn get(&self, item_id: ItemId) -> heed::Result<Option<Leaf<'t, D>>> {
        let len = match self.constant_length {
            Some(len) => len,
            None => return Ok(None),
        };
        let ptr = match self.item_ids.rank(item_id).checked_sub(1).and_then(|offset| self.offsets.get(offset)) {
            Some(ptr) => *ptr,
            None => return Ok(None),
        };
        let bytes = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len) };
        ItemCodec::bytes_decode(bytes).map(Some)
    }
}

unsafe impl<D> Sync for ImmutableItems<'_, D> {}
```

You have also probably noticed some other fun optimizations in this simplified version of the data structure. We also know that the user-item nodes have a constant length, so I decided to store it only once, reducing the offsets vector's size by two. Considering that our objective is to store 100M vectors and that this vector is in memory, we shrunk its size from 1526 MiB to 763MiB, which is not much, but better than nothing.

#### Writing the Tree Nodes in Parallel

Ok! Now that we know how to store pointers to items and share them between threads without any user-end synchronization, we need to generate the tree nodes using it. We already know how to deal with LMDB at Meilisearch and decided to implement the same workaround. To write in parallel into LMDB, write into different, independent files and merge everything afterward. This leverages the [Share-Nothing principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture) and isolates the algorithms. This drastically reduces the number of synchronization points [compared to the original C++ code](https://github.com/spotify/annoy/blob/2be37c9e015544be2cf60c431f0cccc076151a2d/src/annoylib.h#L1344-L1445) (look at the `.lock/unlock` calls) to a single line in our code: the atomically increasing global tree node ID.

```rust
pub fn next_node_id(&self) -> u64 {
    self.0.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed)
}
```

Our functions that generate normal split nodes based on the user-item nodes are now simply writing the nodes into independent files. The [nodes are appended into a file](https://github.com/meilisearch/arroy/blob/4f193fd534acd357b65bfe9eec4b3fed8ece2007/src/parallel.rs#L20-L71), and the on-disk offsets and bounds are stored into a vector, a single `usize` by node. Using Rayon, we run all tree-generation functions in parallel and, once completed, retrieve the files and boundaries to write the uniquely identified nodes into LMDB sequentially.

### Performances Comparison

Our objective at Meilisearch is to support 100M embedding of around 768 dimensions. If we store those as `f32` vectors without any [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), it would be equivalent to `100M * 768 * 4 = 307B`, in other words, 286 GiB to store the vectors raw, without any internal tree nodes, i.e., no way to search in them efficiently.

If you don't specify the number of trees to generate, the algorithm will continue to create trees while the number of tree nodes is smaller than the number of item vectors. At the end, there must be roughly the same number of tree nodes and items.

#### Discovering the Limit of Vectors We Can Index

Arroy and Annoy use memory mapping extensively but in slightly different ways. In a previous article from @dureuill, we saw that [operating systems do not have infinite memory-map space](https://blog.meilisearch.com/dynamic-virtual-address-management/). So, let's dive into performance results.

I noticed something strange when running Arroy with 25M vectors of 768 dimensions. The CPUs were not used, and the program seemed to read the SSD/NVMe a lot, too much 🤔 The tree generation algorithm is splitting the vector space into subdomains with fewer vectors. Still, it must first find the appropriate normal to split the entire domain, and for that, it randomly selects many items. Unfortunately, my machine only has 63 GiB of memory, and indexing those 25M items requires more than 72 Gib. Annoy was also struggling in the same way.

![We cannot index 25M vectors of 768 dimensions with 63 GiB](https://i.imgur.com/aKCovsM.png)

After investigating, I understood why the whole swap space and memory mapping limits were reached. The item nodes were not only _768 * 4 bytes_ because we store the norm and other stuff alongside the vectors, but in the case of Arroy, LMDB needs to maintain BTree data structures around the entries, and those are also tacking memory-mapped space. Both programs request random item nodes unavailable in memory, so the OS fetches them from the disk, which takes time. Ho and every single thread is doing that in parallel. CPUs are simply awaiting the disk.

So, after some dichotomy, I found the point where arroy successfully used all of the memory without being bound to the disk speed. It can index 15.625M on a 63 GiB machine. You can see on this htop screenshot that the disk read speed is at zero as all of the vectors fit in RAM, that arroy is writing the tree nodes to disk, and that the CPUs are doing their best. It took less than seven hours to process.

![Successfully indexing 15.6M vector of 768 dimensions with 63 GiB](https://i.imgur.com/N4ksrIq.png)

But... Annoy cannot index this same number of documents. It suffers from the same issue we saw before: high disk read and low CPU usage. But why? I needed clarification because the nodes have the same format, the number of item vectors to index is the same, and the algorithm has been ported. So, what is the difference between both solutions?

For those who looked into the C++ codebase and were probably hinted by the memory mapping issue described earlier, you probably noticed this slight difference: Arroy is writing the generated tree nodes into different raw files when Annoy, on the contrary, is [reserving space into the memory-mapped file and directly writing into it](https://github.com/spotify/annoy/blob/2be37c9e015544be2cf60c431f0cccc076151a2d/src/annoylib.h#L1354-L1370). By doing this trick, the OS needs to keep much more space in the memory-mapped area and is forced to invalidate the item nodes from the cache to keep the just-written tree nodes hot in the cache, slowing down the system for no reason, as the tree nodes are not necessary for the algorithm.

So, after even more dichotomy to find the Annoy limits on a 63 GiB machine, I discovered that it could roughly index 10M vectors in five hours.

#### The Share Nothing Principle to the Win

So Arroy can index 36% more vectors on the same machine, but how long does it take? Wouldn't it be faster to write into the same file in parallel instead of copying all those tree nodes in a single-threaded way? It will be a much shorter paragraph as I only did some small tests, but Arroy is always faster!

|       | number of vectors | number of threads | building time |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Annoy | 96k               | 1                 | 5min 38s      |
| arroy | 96k               | 1                 | **3min 45s**  |
| Annoy | 96k               | 12                | 1min 9s       |
| arroy | 96k               | 12                | **54s**       |
| Annoy | 10M               | 12                | 5h 40min      |
| arroy | 10M               | 12                | **4h 17min**  |
| Annoy | 15.625M           | 12                | --            |
| arroy | 15.625M           | 12                | **7h 22min**  |

Now, you probably tell me that I will need around 400GiB of memory to index 100M vectors, and you are probably right, but @irevoire will talk about incremental indexing in a future article. I did a linear regression for fun. With those 12 threads and the required memory, I predicted it would take one day, 22 hours, and 43 min 😬. Ho! As we also use this vector store in Meilisearch, we need to provide ways to filter this data structure at search time. This is the next article in this series.

### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?

core

### Description

Using the `toSignal` function inside a `computed` function lead to the following error: `Error: NG0602: toSignal() cannot be called from within a reactive context. Invoking `toSignal` causes new subscriptions every time. Consider moving `toSignal` outside of the reactive context and read the signal value where needed. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0602`.

I understand the risk of having multiple subscritpions generated by the change of a signal value into the `computed` function.
But on the other hand it make sense to have a signal to store data that is build from a computed calls which contains the server call like this: 
```
product = computed(() =>
   toSignal(this.productService.getProduct(this.productId() /* <- a signal */), {
      initialValue: null,
  })()
);
```

Here `this.productId` can be a signal comming from an `input` or a route param.

At the moment, we would have to write something like this:
```
product = toSignal(
    toObservable(this.productId)
    .pipe(
      switchMap(productId => this.productService.getProduct(productId))
    )
  , { initialValue: null })
```

Would it be possible to have Angular compiling the first showed code into the second one ?

I've created a [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nqf5mn?description=An%20angular-cli%20project%20based%20on%20@angular/animations,%20@angular/common,%20@angular/compiler,%20@angular/core,%20@angular/forms,%20@angular/platform-browser,%20@angular/platform-browser-dynamic,%20@angular/router,%20core-js,%20rxjs,%20tslib%20and%20zone.js&file=src%2Fmain.ts,package.json&title=Angular%20Starter) as a playground.

### Proposed solution

I'm definetly not an expert with tools like babel or so...
So I asked chatGPT few questions and he suggested me a solution which can be a good start for a line of thought (even if the proposed solution is not generic).

```
const babel = require('@babel/core');

// Original code as a string
const originalCode = `
  computed(() => toSignal(this.productService.getProduct(this._productId()), { initialValue: null })())
`;

// Modify code using Babel
const modifiedCode = babel.transformSync(originalCode, {
  plugins: [
    // Use a custom Babel plugin to modify the AST
    function ({ types }) {
      return {
        visitor: {
          // Visit ArrowFunctionExpression nodes
          ArrowFunctionExpression(path) {
            // Check if the arrow function is part of the computed function
            if (
              path.parent.type === 'CallExpression' &&
              path.parent.callee.name === 'computed'
            ) {
              // Replace the arrow function with a new one
              path.replaceWith(
                types.arrowFunctionExpression(
                  path.node.params,
                  // Create a new AST for the desired modified code
                  types.callExpression(
                    types.identifier('toSignal'),
                    [
                      types.callExpression(
                        types.identifier('toObservable'),
                        [path.node.body.arguments[0].object.property]
                      ),
                      types.objectExpression([
                        types.objectProperty(
                          types.identifier('initialValue'),
                          types.nullLiteral()
                        ),
                      ]),
                    ]
                  )
                )
              );
            }
          },
        },
      };
    },
  ],
}).code;

// Log the modified code
console.log(modifiedCode);

```

### Alternatives considered

I know that in the vue ecosystem, there is the [vueuse](https://vueuse.org/) which exposes a [computedAsync](https://vueuse.org/core/computedAsync/#computedasync) function which broadly does what we want."

### Describe the bug

I can't send my any sort of files either png,mp4,mp3,etc from PC to android using an external storage, however it can send files to the internal storage. I'm encountering a persistent error [500] on my windows, while my phone reports a PathAccessException: Creation failed, path = ""SD Card directory"" (OS Error: Permission denied, errno = 13). I searched up the issues #710 and it seems that correlates with this one.

I tried enabling android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE for LocalSend in an app called App Ops but I couldn't find it and used Powershell to type this: .\adb shell appops set --uid org.localsend.localsend_app MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow. And also tried this as well:  

.\adb shell appops set --uid org.localsend.localsend_app MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow
.\adb shell ""appops set --uid 'org.localsend.localsend_app' MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow""
.\adb shell pm grant org.localsend.localsend_app android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

I'm not a programmer by the way and used ChatGPT 3.5 to find out the problem and it said that ""It appears that the prompt either appops, pm grant and android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission are not recognized by your device or Android version"". 

Android 8 only includes READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE in which are have been allowed access in both LocalSend app info and in App Ops standalone application.

Hi there,

I just started using this library, and I am also new to computational geometry so please bear with me..

I am trying to fit a cuboid to some points, but I just realized that the `Cuboid.fit()` result is just returning 3 planes. I expected it to return 6 planes, as I don't see how 3 planes can fully parametrize a cuboid object.

I felt pretty dumb and was sure I was missing something, so I asked ChatGPT which seems to agree that we need 6 planes and not 3.. now I am even more confused.

What am I missing?"

I'm currently writing a custom IRoboCommand to orchestrate building a complex file batch that pulls from various folders and singular files to a final destination. As such, I've written an interface that has a method for CopyToAsync() to copy a file from source to destination asynchronously. I'm creating this thread to document some benchmarks, as RoboCopy is great at what it does.

I used ChatGPT and the [microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o) to create some async methods to handle the copying that reports via an `IProgress<long>` object. As well as a project developed to use [CopyFileEx ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-copyfileexa)to perform the copy operation.

The benchmark for these tests was run in a console app in release mode, using a 334MB file. Each copy operation was performed 10x and the time report was the average result. My goal was to determine if a comparable time-to-copy could be achieve for a single file that falls within the current documentation recommendations I've been able to track down over a few days.

Note : This test was done on a console application targeting Net5.0 (as my work computer does not have VS2022 yet). Net6.0 benchmarks will happen in a followup comment.

This can result in CDFs that are not monotonically increasing and thus invalid.

After [asking ChatGPT for some ideas](https://chat.openai.com/share/eba9cb75-7dae-4e38-8ccb-55b5eb1ebd34), I think a promising approach could be first synthesizing a pdf from the quantiles, smoothing it with a kernel density estimator, then integrating it to a cdf.

The log in and link scraping aspects seem to work fine. However, instead of clicking on the ""Easy Apply"" button, it clicks on whatever button is in the top right of your LinkedIn page. Before, it was clicking onto LinkedIn Learning, but then I disconnected LinkedIn Learning just to see if that would resolve the problem. Now it clicks on the ""Try Premium"" button, as it is now at the top right of the page. 

I tried several things to debug, but I am not a JS developer by any means. 

I attempted going through inspect element to figure out what the selector for the button ought to be, and it appeared that 'button.jobs-apply-button[aria-label^=""Easy Apply""]' would do the trick. 

```
const easyApplyButtonSelector = 'button.jobs-apply-button[aria-label^=""Easy Apply""]';
await page.waitForSelector(selectors.easyApplyButtonEnabled, { timeout: 10000 });
await page.click(easyApplyButtonSelector);

The above made no difference. I consulted ChatGPT for a suggestion and tried the following:

```  const easyApplyButtonSelector = 'button.jobs-apply-button[aria-label^=""Easy Apply""]';

Thank you for your hard work!

I use your IPadapter nodes for a variety of workflows that i  have consolidated trough time, and it would be a real pain for me to reconstruct them all, mostly because I have many workflows that differ slightly between one another, and it would mean reconstructing them one by one.

### Current behavior

I'm having issues in my app where I navigate to a page, the RAM usage increases, then I navigate back, expecting the memory consumption to go back down, but the RAM usage stays high.

Here is a repo where I provide a reproducible example: https://github.com/spagrhetti/performance-debugging

The basic setup is this:

1. My app has two screens, screen A and screen B, both screens in a React Navigation Stack Navigator. We start on screen A.
2. Navigate to screen B. Screen B has a button that adds a giant string to a useState array. Do this however much you want, after 2 presses RAM usage goes up from ~100MB to about ~850MB on my device (iphone 12 mini).
3. Navigate back to screen A. I would expect memory to go back down, but it stays at that ~850MB level.
Additionally, here is a video of the test: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ubiYwzrlaQw

Am I missing something? Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior of having RAM go down after navigating back?

I've asked chatGPT about this and it basically tells me that garbage collection in javascript is hard to predict and maybe somehow that memory will get freed later. However, I think that variations of this behavior are causing my app to steadily use more and more RAM as I navigate around, eventually causing it to crash.

Any help on understanding why this occurs and how to better handle memory when dealing with React Navigation would be greatly appreciated!

Note: I notice similar behavior without any navigation involved: allocating a big state var, then setting it to null, RAM usage stays high. I don't completely understand this -- my guess is that I just have to wait for garbage collection to kick in and eventually bring RAM usage back down. However, in my app, that never seems to happen, it just keeps going up and eventually it crashes.

### Expected behavior

I would expect RAM to go back down after navigating back to page A.

### Reproduction

**Describe the bug**
There seems to be a problem with `authorData` being passed to the `author-extra.html` partial. I asked chatgpt for solution and it gave me the solution - which is to edit the `author-extra.html` partial as I described below. 

I edited the partial and then it was fixed. 

(I am not a developer and I have no idea what I am about to say here.)

**To Reproduce**
For author, in the front matter, I pur input data in the image option. However, the image was not there. When I run hugo server, I receive an error. 

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: windows
 
**Hugo & Blowfish versions**
Both latest. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

The error message indicates that Hugo is trying to fetch an image from a remote location using the `resources.GetRemote` function, but the URL of the image (`img/author-image.jpg`) does not have a valid protocol scheme (like `http://` or `https://`). 

This issue is likely occurring because the `authorData` being passed to the `author-extra.html` partial contains a relative path to the image instead of an absolute URL. 

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `image` field in the `authorData` contains an absolute URL to the image if you want to use `resources.GetRemote`. If the images are stored locally in your Hugo site, you can use `resources.Get` instead of `resources.GetRemote`.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `author-extra.html` partial to use `resources.Get`:

```html
{{ $authorImage := resources.Get .data.image }}
{{ $resizedImage := $authorImage.Fill ""150x150"" }}
<img src=""{{ $resizedImage.Permalink }}"" alt=""{{ .data.name }}"">
```

In this code, `resources.Get` is used to get the image from the local file system, and then `Fill` is used to resize the image. The `Permalink` attribute is used to get the URL of the resized image.

Please replace the existing code in `author-extra.html` with the above code and try building your Hugo site again. Let me know if you have any other questions! 😊

Hi, I'm new to coding and just learning nvim because I hate making progress in my life and prefer side-quests instead, apparently. Anyway...

I am using nvim w/ kickstart's config to edit a `.css` file and when I try to write css for the `*` selector, the...autocomplete...thing (idk what it's called) seems to treat it as a multi-line comment. What I mean is, if I start with:
```css
* {}
```
and then press `<Enter>` with my cursor between the braces, I end up with:
```css
* {
        * 
* }
```
instead of 
```css
* {
   
}

I know it's probably some plugin or something that does this, but I'm not sure which one or which one I should file the actual bug report with. I asked ChatGPT and it said that tree-sitter-css is only for syntax highlighting and since it's the only css thing I remember installing during the setup of neovim, I'm not sure what else to look for.

Hi,
I'm running red_oxide v0.8.2 on WSL Ubuntu with a SMB share drive mounted. All of my directories are on the shared drive.
The transcoding finishes on all of the files, but the program stops with OS error 1.
I have identified that fs::copy in src/transcode/util.rs is causing the error when it tries to copy the thumbnail to the new transcoded folder. 
Using a drop-in copy function from ChatGPT that doesn't use fs::copy works, but I'm not sure how you would want to fix it. I can do a PR with the change that works for me if you would like.

Hi, Thank you for the detailed CUDA and TensorRT tutorials. They’ve really helped me out.

I encountered a strange phenomenon and I hope you can help analyze it. When executing the code from Section 6.2-deploy-classification-advanced, I encounter a uniform but incorrect inference output across various images when processed using GPU. The output is as follows:

```shell
[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx

[info]Image:      wolf.png
[info]Inference result: cleaver, meat cleaver, chopper
[info]Confidence is 3.092%
```

The inference results are the same for all pictures, So I started trying to debug to find the problem. First, I set the `params.dev = model::device::CPU` to see if it was a problem with the pre-processing and post-processing on the GPU. And I found that the result inference on the CPU works fine, The output is as follows:

```shell
[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      cat.png
[info]Inference result: Egyptian cat
[info]Confidence is 45.422%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx

[info]Confidence is 99.869%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      fox.png
[info]Inference result: red fox, Vulpes vulpes
[info]Confidence is 80.789%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx

[info]Inference result: Persian cat
[info]Confidence is 75.310%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      wolf.png
[info]Inference result: timber wolf, grey wolf, gray wolf, Canis lupus
[info]Confidence is 39.663%
```

So I seriously suspect that there is a problem with the pre-processing or post-processing implementation on the GPU, I found that the post-processing part of the classification task was relatively simple and was not implemented on the GPU, so I positioned the problem on the implementation of `preprocess_gpu` function.

I found that the default strategy adopted in the `process::preprocess_resize_gpu` is `process::tactics::GPU_BILINEAR`, I tried changing it to `process::tactics::GPU_NEAREST` and got the following output:

```shell
[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      cat.png
[info]Inference result: Egyptian cat
[info]Confidence is 24.423%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      gazelle.png
[info]Inference result: gazelle
[info]Confidence is 37.486%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      eagle.png
[info]Inference result: bald eagle, American eagle, Haliaeetus leucocephalus
[info]Confidence is 99.946%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      fox.png
[info]Inference result: red fox, Vulpes vulpes
[info]Confidence is 86.935%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      tiny-cat.png
[info]Inference result: Persian cat
[info]Confidence is 76.643%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      wolf.png
[info]Inference result: coyote, prairie wolf, brush wolf, Canis latrans
[info]Confidence is 70.486%
```

The output is normal, so I think there is a problem with the implementation part of the `bilinear_BGR2RGB_nhwc2nchw_norm_kernel` kernel function. But I read the code carefully and didn't find any problems. Even I asked ChatGPT to analyze it for me, but I didn't get any useful suggestions.

So I started trying to save the image data processed by the kernel function and use python to view it. I found that all the values in the pre-processed image data were **zero**! So I decided that there should be a problem with the implementation of some parts of the kernel function. I found that the kernel function does not calculate out-of-bounds coordinates and does nothing, like follows:

```cpp
if (src_y1 < 0 || src_x1 < 0 || src_y2 > srcH || src_x2 > srcW) {
    // bilinear interpolation -- 对于越界的坐标不进行计算
} else {
    // bilinear interpolation -- 计算原图上的坐标(浮点类型)在0~1之间的值
	...
}
```

This seems to be no problem, and the kernel function of nearest neighbor interpolation also does this. I accidentally thought of adding an extra `return;` when the coordinates are out of bounds, as follows:

```cpp
if (src_y1 < 0 || src_x1 < 0 || src_y2 > srcH || src_x2 > srcW) {
    // bilinear interpolation -- 对于越界的坐标不进行计算
    return;  // Newly added
} else {
    // bilinear interpolation -- 计算原图上的坐标(浮点类型)在0~1之间的值
	...
}
```

When I run it again I got the correct value, The output is as follows:

```shell
[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      cat.png
[info]Inference result: Egyptian cat
[info]Confidence is 45.700%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      gazelle.png
[info]Inference result: gazelle
[info]Confidence is 62.227%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      eagle.png
[info]Inference result: bald eagle, American eagle, Haliaeetus leucocephalus
[info]Confidence is 99.873%

[info]Model:      resnet50.onnx
[info]Image:      fox.png
[info]Inference result: red fox, Vulpes vulpes

[info]Image:      wolf.png
[info]Inference result: timber wolf, grey wolf, gray wolf, Canis lupus
[info]Confidence is 40.196%
```

I asked ChatGPT and the reason it gave was that an out-of-bounds thread not returned might access an invalid memory address, leading to undefined behavior. But doesn't nearest neighbor interpolation do the same? Why is there no such problem?

So I want to know if you have the same problem and what is the reason why this problem occurs.

Thank you very much.

### Prerequisites

- [X] Write a descriptive title.
- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
- [X] Search the existing issues.
- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).
- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).

### Steps to reproduce

**Situation Where This Occurs:** When a system is set up with any security/execution policy that causes PowerShell to run in Constrained Language mode by default, such as the PowerShell Core Group Policy Editor execution policy being set as ""Allow only signed scripts"", or AppLocker rules that require whitelisting to run in Full Language mode.

**Problem:** If the user runs the installer and selects to use Microsoft Update (I believe, or otherwise whatever causes `RegisterMicrosoftUpdate.ps1` to be run as part of the installation), and the system is set up as described above, the installer will hang at the end forever showing no error and never complete.

**Root Cause:** The problem exists in `RegisterMicrosoftUpdate.ps1` and the fact that the $jobScript block is run as a new thread which creates a new session outside of the whitelisted session, therefore it is in Constrained Language Mode instead of the outer script's Full Language Mode, so it fails. Then for some reason the installer doesn't notice this and just hangs instead of displaying an error and moving on.

--------

## **More Problem Details**

I noticed the PowerShell 7 MSI installer would freeze near the end and show no movement or message. I ran the MSI installer with verbose logging and it was hanging completely with the last line being this:

```
CAQuietExec:  ""C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"" -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\RegisterMicrosoftUpdate.ps1""
```

To be clear, the script should _theoretically_ be able to run no problem, because in AppLocker I have rules to allow any signed scripts, as well as the powershell core policy in GPE being set to allow only signed scripts (which it is). I also even tried explicitly adding an allow rule on the script's file hash and temporarily changing the group policy GPE setting, but it didn't work (because AppLocker was still active, therefore defaulting to Constrained Language), but given the cause, this is not a surprise. The script itself is running in Full Language mode, that's not the problem, rather the inner code block mentioned before.

Running the script by itself yields these errors:

```
PS C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7> .\RegisterMicrosoftUpdate.ps1
VERBOSE: Running job script:
            # This registers Microsoft Update via a predifened GUID with the Windows Update Agent.

VERBOSE: Opting into Microsoft Update as the Autmatic Update Service
VERBOSE: Result:
VERBOSE: Registration failed
```

With the main problem being:
`Cannot create type. Only core types are supported in this language mode.`

The problem is like I described above, how $scriptBlock is being run in a new session/context so it doesn't inherit the Full Language mode and fails despite being within the allowed script.

### Expected behavior


I would expect the installer to display an error message that the registering to Windows Update had failed but the installation was otherwise a success.


#### Example Solution: 
With the help of ChatGPT I had it create a version of the script that runs the script block in the same context and works:

```
param(
    [ValidateSet('Hang', 'Fail')]
    $TestHook
)

$waitTimeoutSeconds = 300
switch ($TestHook) {
    'Hang' {
        $waitTimeoutSeconds = 10
        $jobScript = { Start-Sleep -Seconds 600 }
    }
    'Fail' {
        $jobScript = { throw ""This job script should fail"" }
    }
    default {
        $jobScript = {
            # This registers Microsoft Update via a predifened GUID with the Windows Update Agent.
            # https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wua_sdk/opt-in-to-microsoft-update

            $serviceManager = (New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.ServiceManager)
            $isRegistered = $serviceManager.QueryServiceRegistration('7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d').Service.IsRegisteredWithAu

            if (!$isRegistered) {
                Write-Verbose -Verbose ""Opting into Microsoft Update as the Automatic Update Service""
                # 7 is the combination of asfAllowPendingRegistration, asfAllowOnlineRegistration, asfRegisterServiceWithAU
                # AU means Automatic Updates
                $null = $serviceManager.AddService2('7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d', 7, '')
            }
            else {
                Write-Verbose -Verbose ""Microsoft Update is already registered for Automatic Updates""
            }

            $isRegistered = $serviceManager.QueryServiceRegistration('7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d').Service.IsRegisteredWithAu

            # Return if it was successful, which is the opposite of Pending.
            return $isRegistered
        }
    }
}

Write-Verbose ""Running job script"" -Verbose

# Run the script block synchronously in the current session
$result = & $jobScript

Write-Verbose ""Result: $result"" -Verbose
if ($result) {
    Write-Verbose ""Registration succeeded"" -Verbose
    exit 0
}
else {
    Write-Verbose ""Registration failed"" -Verbose
    # at the time this was written, the MSI is ignoring the exit code
    exit 1
}
```


### Actual behavior

Installer hangs forever until force quit with Task manager.

I added logging lines to various parts of the script to see the language mode at different parts which revealed that part of it was running in constrained language mode.

Here is the modified script:

```
param(
    [ValidateSet('Hang', 'Fail')]
    $TestHook
)

Write-Output ""1 The execution policy is: $($ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode)`n""

    }
    'Fail' {
        $jobScript = { throw ""This job script should fail"" }
    }
    default {
        $jobScript = {

                $null = $serviceManager.AddService2('7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d', 7, '')
				Write-Output ""5 The execution policy is: $($ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode)`n""
            }
            else {
                Write-Verbose -Verbose ""Microsoft Update is already registered for Automatic Updates""
            }

            $isRegistered = $serviceManager.QueryServiceRegistration('7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d').Service.IsRegisteredWithAu
			Write-Output ""6 The execution policy is: $($ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode)`n""
            # Return if it was successful, which is the opposite of Pending.
            return $isRegistered
        }
    }
}

Write-Verbose ""Running job script: $jobScript"" -Verbose
$job = Start-ThreadJob -ScriptBlock $jobScript

Write-Verbose ""Waiting on Job for $waitTimeoutSeconds seconds"" -Verbose
$null = Wait-Job -Job $job -Timeout $waitTimeoutSeconds

if ($job.State -ne 'Running') {
    Write-Verbose ""Job finished.  State: $($job.State)"" -Verbose
    $result = Receive-Job -Job $job -Verbose
    Write-Verbose ""Result: $result"" -Verbose
    if ($result) {
        Write-Verbose ""Registration succeeded"" -Verbose
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Verbose ""Registration failed"" -Verbose
        # at the time this was written, the MSI is ignoring the exit code
        exit 1
    }
}
else {

    Write-Verbose ""Stopping Job.  State: $($job.State)"" -Verbose
    Stop-Job -Job $job
    # at the time this was written, the MSI is ignoring the exit code
    exit 258
}
```

And its output:

This is my first issue, so forgive me in case of a wrong usage or duple issue, but couldn't find anything.

#### ALL software version info
panel==1.3.8

#### Description of expected behavior and the observed behavior

Originally the accordion loads correctly, but after toggling off and on the accordion using the button, the displayed names are all messed up. Clicking on the accordion correct the problem.

#### Complete, minimal, self-contained example code that reproduces the issue
I used ChatGPT to create a easy example of this issue.
```
import panel as pn

# Initialize the panel extension
pn.extension()

# Define the content for each panel
panel1 = pn.pane.Markdown(""## Panel 1 Content\nThis is the content of the first panel."")
panel2 = pn.pane.Markdown(""## Panel 2 Content\nThis is the content of the second panel."")
panel3 = pn.pane.Markdown(""## Panel 3 Content\nThis is the content of the third panel."")

# Create the accordion
accordion = pn.Accordion(('Panel 1', panel1), ('Panel 2', panel2), ('Panel 3', panel3))

# Create the button
toggle_button = pn.widgets.Button(name='Toggle Accordion', button_type='primary')

# Define the callback function to toggle the visibility
def toggle_accordion(event):
    accordion.visible = not accordion.visible

# Attach the callback to the button
toggle_button.on_click(toggle_accordion)

# Layout the button and accordion
layout = pn.Column(toggle_button, accordion)

# Serve the layout
layout.show()


```

### Check for existing issues

- [X] Completed

### Describe the bug / provide steps to reproduce it

Hello,

I have encountered an issue with the Zed code editor when trying to add ** around a selected word to bold it. When I select a word and attempt to add ** at the start and end in one go, the editor deletes the selected word instead. This behavior does not occur when using brackets; adding brackets around a selected word works as expected.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Select a word in the editor.
2. Attempt to add `**`/`__`/`==`/`` ` `` at the start and end of the selected word simultaneously.

Expected behavior:
The selected word should be wrapped in `**` and remain intact.

Actual behavior:
The selected word is deleted.

This issue affects the efficiency of formatting text in markdown or similar syntaxes where bolding text is required.

Thank you for looking into this!

Best regards,
Anshul Raj Verma

I have a server that's returning OPML files. 

It's not the first time I've done this, but now there seem to be enough other people interested in this that it's worth raising this question. 

What content type should I use? Generally I've been using text/xml. 

But I see other people using text/opml. 

I asked ChatGPT what it thinks and it [says](https://chatgpt.com/share/d7864fe3-3f05-4588-bfe1-a5c3ec48baa9) that text/x-opml is the standard.

[ warning message ] 
2024-06-25 06:29:56.243 Python[14458:2546187] WARNING: Secure coding is not enabled for restorable state! Enable secure coding by implementing NSApplicationDelegate.applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState: and returning YES.

As I have no knowledge of this, I asked ChatGPT about this warning and received the following response
Is this an effect of some change in version 2.1?

This warning message relates to the development of macOS applications.Specifically, it indicates that a Python script is utilising native macOS functionality and that the security settings related to the State Restore functionality are not enabled. 
Details are provided below.

NSApplicationDelegate.applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState:.
This is a macOS application delegate method that specifies whether the application supports secure state restoration.
Secure state restoration is the ability to save the application's state and restore it securely on restart.
Cause of warning.
This warning is displayed when a Python script behaves like a macOS application and there are no security settings for state restoration. This usually occurs when using a wrapper library (e.g. PyObjC) to utilise native macOS functionality in Python.

Hello, I am a regular anime user, for a while I used radarr and sonarr to download content, but this is meaningless if you will not watch it again, but in these programs something called custom format is used which allows the use of regex or many other terms without limits and even with a scoring system to choose the best and download automatically.

![cf-import-to-update](https://github.com/SwagOtaku/plugin.video.kaito/assets/91355308/0a31f18d-6f85-4971-a5c1-ee7f907c3b78)

In these you can incorporate the audio channels, words in the titles, quality, video source among others, but this is very elaborate, I only use it for a brief introduction.

### **OTAKU ADDON**

In otaku we already have the possibility of filtering by words but we only have the possibility of using 5 terms, although this seems like a lot, in some cases it is not enough because many times the titles do not always have the same strings even if they belong to the same group.

That is why it would be interesting to add more fields for greater control or the possibility of entering 5 more terms or even more (the more the better).

**Filtering using Regex**

(?=.*\bMULTi\b)(?=.*\bNanDesuKa\b)(?=.*\(CR\))(?=.*\bSpanish\b).*

This regular expression uses positive lookaheads ((?=...)) to ensure that all keywords are present on the same line. Here is the breakdown of the expression:

1. (?=.*\bMULTi\b) ensures that ""MULTi"" is present on the line.
2. (?=.*\bNanDesuKa\b) ensures that ""NanDesuKa"" is present on the line.
3. (?=.*\(CR\)) ensures that ""(CR)"" is present on the line.
4. (?=.*\bSpanish\b) ensures that ""Spanish"" is present on the line.
5. .* allows the expression to match anything before, between, and after the keywords.

To create this expression, I asked ChatGPT

**In the addon we would introduce it as follows**

With these changes we could obtain better results and even use auto-reproduction.

Making sure to give priority to sources with Dubbing and that in case you don't select one with the other terms.

In my case I consume content with Spanish or Latin Dubbing, I use Kodi's preferences.

### Issue Details

Hi, I asked ChatGPT about the clear data, the simple answer is this: The shortcut ctrl + shift + r/ctrl + F5/shift + F5 just refreshes the page and clears the cache, while the ""Clear Site Data"" option does a more comprehensive data clearing.

Normally I would do this, but sometimes it's hard because the Anti-devtool scripts thing is so annoying. Also, I guess there is no shortcut for this ""Clear site Data"" option.

</p>
</details>

I suggested this feature because AdGuard extension is fully related to data cleaning as well. (triggering factors or outdated data etc.) 

----

There are extensions called ""Clear site data"", examples of features that can be cleared:

</p>
</details>

### Proposed solution

So if it is possible to integrate this ""clear data"" feature to AdGuard extension, it would be good to add a clear data icon to the AdGuard extension drop-down menu and Filtering log. Also keyboard shortcut for AdGuard extension. 😄

This is a raw version that has not been reviewed or corrected. The idea is that together we can create a fully functional final version.
I'm new to Github. This is the easiest way to share the file:
https://cloud.brasdrive.com.br/s/f3cReWoRGAxaDMH

Explanation of the Adaptations Made
Connection to PostgreSQL:

All database connections and queries were changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL using pg_connect, pg_query, and related functions.
Backup and Restore Commands:

The backup and restore commands were changed to use pg_dump and psql instead of mysqldump and mysql.
SQL Queries:

The SQL queries were adapted to use PostgreSQL syntax, including double quotes for identifiers and specific functions like EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...).
Execution Options:

The dry-run, update-db, and delete-local options were kept as they were in the original script.
S3 Compatibility:

The configuration and use of AWS S3 for file synchronization were maintained.
This script should be executed in the Docker environment of Nextcloud to ensure that all dependencies and specific configurations are available. Be sure to make a full backup before running it in your production environment."

I want to be able to define an array that contains exactly the elements of all possible values of a union once.

``` ts
type Union = ""prevStep"" | ""nextStep"" | ""submit"" | ""order"";

// this works:
const list: LiteralList<Union> = [""nextStep"", ""order"", ""prevStep"", ""submit""];

// this fails:
const list: LiteralList<Union> = [""nextStep"", ""order"", ""prevStep"", ""submit"", ""submit""];

// this fails:
const list: LiteralList<Union> = [""nextStep"", ""order"", ""prevStep""];
```

I already made this work with this type:
``` ts
type LiteralList<T extends string, U = T> = [T] extends [never]
  ? []
  : U extends T
  ? [U, ...LiteralList<Exclude<T, U>>]
  : [];
```

I'm not sure though if it makes sense since I asked ChatGPT to do it. 

Is it possible to add this type helper to type-fest?

### Solution for first error

In line 190 of the file track.py (wherever you installed Zotify to, can use the program Everything to find easily on Windows):

Replace

`c = len([file for file in Path(filedir).iterdir() if re.search(f'^{filename}_', str(file))]) + 1`

with

`c = len([file for file in Path(filedir).iterdir() if re.search(fr'^{re.escape(str(filename))}_', str(file))]) + 1`

with

```python
if Path(filename).exists():
    # Decide how to handle the existing file
    # For example, delete it or rename filename_temp differently
    Path(filename).unlink()  # Example: delete existing file
    Path(filename_temp).rename(filename)  # Rename filename_temp to filename
else:
    Path(filename_temp).rename(filename)  # Rename filename_temp to filename

184,679b3f3dcbe8284d7a72da24,issue,learning -> how to use a library/framework/tool,https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4/issues/7673,"Column Visibility Discrepancy and Query Tool Malfunction in pgAdmin
Bug Description

**1. Column Visibility Discrepancy:**

Initially, I reported an issue where I could not see any columns listed under the Columns node in the Restaurants table.
Support staff member Yogesh presumed this was due to user error and instructed me to ensure I was selecting the correct node.
After providing multiple screenshots showing that I was indeed selecting the correct node, Yogesh finally provided a screenshot from his side, indicating he could see 29 columns in the same table.
This confirmed that the issue was not user error but a deeper problem, as I could not see any columns while Yogesh could see all 29.

**2. Query Tool Malfunction:**

Following the confirmation of the column visibility issue, I encountered a new problem with the Query Tool.
When attempting to open the Query Tool as Yogesh had directed me to do so, the following sequence occurred:

A revolving circle icon briefly appears.
This is followed by a flash.
The screen then closes, displaying the message: ""! No data output. Execute a query to get output.""

Despite following guidance from ChatGPT to enable Query Tool Logging and executing the correct steps, the issue persists.

Steps to Reproduce

Attempt to open the Query Tool.
Observe the revolving circle icon, followed by a flash and the error message.
Check the Columns node in the Restaurants table and note the absence of columns.
Expected Behavior
The Query Tool should open without errors, allowing queries to be executed.
Columns in the Restaurants table should be visible and accessible.
Troubleshooting Steps Taken
Attempted to enable Query Tool Logging as per ChatGPT's instructions but could not locate the Logging option.
Ensured that I was selecting the Restaurants table correctly, but the columns remain invisible.
Screenshot of Query Tool error is attached.

Additional Context
The support staff initially presumed user error for the column visibility issue.
After confirming that I was selecting the correct node, it was verified by Yogesh through a screenshot that he could see 29 columns while I could see none.
Following this, the Query Tool malfunction became apparent, further complicating the issue.
Yogesh has since shifted focus back to user error, disregarding the earlier confirmed problem.
Conclusion
Given these issues and the unproductive nature of current support interactions, I seek detailed guidance from a higher level of support. There appears to be a connection between the column visibility problem and the Query Tool malfunction. Reinstalling pgAdmin is a consideration, but given that my initial setup was correct, I am uncertain and very doubtful that this will resolve the issues.

Your assistance in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Reuben

### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
#include ""interception.h""

void process_key_event(InterceptionKeyStroke& stroke) {
    std::cout << ""Key event: code = "" << stroke.code
              << "", state = "" << stroke.state << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    InterceptionContext context;
    InterceptionDevice device;
    InterceptionStroke stroke;

    context = interception_create_context();

    interception_set_filter(context, interception_is_keyboard, INTERCEPTION_FILTER_KEY_DOWN | INTERCEPTION_FILTER_KEY_UP);

    while (interception_receive(context, device = interception_wait(context), &stroke, 1) > 0) {
        if (interception_is_keyboard(device)) {
            InterceptionKeyStroke& keyStroke = *(InterceptionKeyStroke*)&stroke;
            
            // Process key event
            process_key_event(keyStroke);

            // Continue sending the stroke to the OS
            interception_send(context, device, &stroke, 1);
        }
    }

    interception_destroy_context(context);

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the device ID used for filtering matches the specific keyboard or mouse you want to intercept.
- The Interception library operates at a low level and may require administrative privileges.
- Some special keys may require additional handling based on their unique key codes or state information."
187,679b4a5dcbe8284d7a72dfaf,issue,software quality -> fixing -> functional bugs,https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim/issues/663,"Backlinks Not Recognized When Using Wikilinks with DisplayText/Alias and Without File Extension
### 🐛 Describe the bug

#### Description

The plugin fails to recognize backlinks if the link uses different display text or an alias without including the file extension. This behavior differs from Obsidian, which correctly identifies backlinks in such cases.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a note, e.g., `NoteA.md`.
2. Create another note, e.g., `NoteB.md`, and link to `NoteA` using `[[NoteA|Display Text]]` or `[[NoteA#section|Display Text]]` (without the `.md` extension).
3. The backlink to `NoteA` is not recognized by the plugin.

#### Expected Behavior

The plugin should recognize backlinks even when the file extension is omitted and different display text or aliases are used, consistent with Obsidian's behavior.

#### Actual Behavior

The plugin only recognizes backlinks with display text or aliases when the file extension is included in the link.

| Link Type                     | Link to file Works | Backlinking Works | Notes                                   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `[[dir/filename.md]]`         | Yes                | Yes               | Full path with extension                |
| `[[filename.md]]`             | Yes                | Yes               | Filename with extension                 |
| `[[filename]]`                | Yes                | Yes               | Filename without extension              |
| `[[dir/filename.md\|alias]]`  | Yes                | Yes               | Full path with extension and alias      |
| `[[filename.md\|alias]]`      | Yes                | Yes               | Filename with extension and alias       |
| `[[filename\|alias]]`         | Yes                | No                | Filename without extension and alias    |

I also noticed that if a wikilink is used with just the filename without extension and using an alias, and the filename used in the link matches the id in the frontmatter of the linked note, the backlink works. but if using a random id then it doesnt work.

#### Proposed Solution

i asked chatgpt and it came up with following fix which actully works:

Update the backlink search functionality to include variations of the file name without the file extension in the search terms when using different display text or aliases. This would involve modifying the search terms generation to handle links both with and without the file extension.

## Additional context
I used ChatGPT to generate a press release using the prompt: “generate a fake press release about some medical breakthough at the University of Arizona"" The following is the fake press release it generated:

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**University of Arizona Unveils Pioneering Treatment for Type 1 Diabetes: A Game-Changer for Patients**

*Tucson, AZ – July 31, 2024* – The University of Arizona has announced a groundbreaking medical breakthrough in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, unveiling a revolutionary new therapy that holds the potential to dramatically alter the management of this chronic condition. The innovative treatment, known as Insulix-21, has demonstrated remarkable success in early clinical trials, offering new hope to millions of individuals living with Type 1 diabetes.

Developed by the University of Arizona's Center for Endocrine Research, Insulix-21 is a novel therapy that combines cutting-edge stem cell technology with advanced immunomodulation techniques. This dual-action approach not only aims to restore the body's ability to produce insulin but also prevents the autoimmune response that attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Dr. Maria Alvarez, the principal investigator and Professor of Endocrinology at the University of Arizona, elaborated on the breakthrough: ""Insulix-21 represents a significant advancement in Type 1 diabetes treatment. By leveraging stem cells to regenerate pancreatic beta cells and incorporating immunomodulatory agents to protect these cells from immune system attacks, we are addressing the root causes of the disease.""

In a recent clinical trial involving 120 participants, Insulix-21 demonstrated a 65% reduction in insulin dependence and a 50% improvement in glycemic control over a 12-month period. Patients also reported enhanced quality of life and reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications.

Dr. Alvarez expressed her excitement about the potential impact of Insulix-21: ""This breakthrough has the potential to not only manage Type 1 diabetes more effectively but also offer a path towards long-term remission for many patients. The early results are incredibly promising, and we are eager to continue our research and bring this transformative therapy to the wider community.""

The University of Arizona is now preparing for larger-scale trials and is in discussions with leading pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the development and availability of Insulix-21. Additionally, the university has established a comprehensive support program to assist patients and families in accessing this cutting-edge therapy and managing their diabetes effectively.

This achievement highlights the University of Arizona's dedication to advancing medical research and improving patient outcomes. The Insulix-21 team is optimistic about the potential of this new treatment to make a significant difference in the lives of individuals affected by Type 1 diabetes.

**What are you trying to do?**
Trying to setup my premake 5.lua script to build an intel fortran project.

**What problem are you having?**
I'm getting the following Error: invalid value 'intel' for toolset

I was originally following along from [this](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/issues/1309) issue which solved the language problem with setting the language to Fortran. But now I'm not sure what to do about the toolset being set to intel. I can't find the UUID to do the same thing that was done with the language

**What have you tried so far?**
I've tried looking elsewhere, at public repos and asking chatGPT for assistance with my config. I have also tried manually searching through an already existing sln for this info that had the type of project that I'm trying to get my premake script to create

**What version of Premake are you using?**
premake-5.0.0-beta2

**Anything else we should know?**
My script is building a solution with with that will have a C++ SharedLib and a Fortran StaticLib. I also have the following in a .bat file that I'm not entirely sure how to make it work with the prior solution yet

I have a couple of vms I use to run my docker containers. As I spin up/shut down containers, my ports may change. 
I propose the ability to schedule nmap scans and update known hosts accordingly. 

So far, I had good success with using chatgpt to convert nmap output to json input and using the import feature, but obviously this is a manual process. "

Read the FAQ first: https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/wiki/FAQ

Do NOT create issues for questions, use the discussion forum: https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/discussions



Description
===========
When an application uses librdkafka and another library that uses SIGCHLD for its own purposes, SIGCHLD will not be ignored and cannot, must not be ignored. When the application uses kerberos with kafka then librdkafka will run the kinit command. It uses the system call to do this, see the function rd_kafka_sasl_cyrus_kinit_refresh. This means the calling thread will receive SIGCHLD. The code is assuming that the caller will be able to disable that signal. This assumption is not stated anywhere in the documentation. It is quite common to disable that signal. However, not every application can do so. Those that can't, ones that use SIGCHLD for reasons of their own, will get their handler invoked when the kinit command completes. This is certainly not the intention of librdkafka.

How to reproduce
================
I cannot reproduce any of the details of the application I am working on, since it is proprietary. All I can say is that I am using librdkafka 2.2.0 on RHEL8 and the app is configured to use kerberos authentication with the kinit command configured as the appropriate kafka parameter. The application is also using a proprietary library that uses SIGCHLD for its own purposes. The thread that uses librdkafka is started by that proprietary library so when SIGCHLD is received that library reports that SIGCHLD has been received. The app is a long-running app so its logfile contains many of these messages as the day goes on.

Checklist
=========
**IMPORTANT**: We will close issues where the checklist has not been completed.
Please provide the following information:

 - [x] librdkafka version (release number or git tag): `<REPLACE with e.g., v0.10.5 or a git sha. NOT ""latest"" or ""current"">`
 2.2.0 
 - [ ] Apache Kafka version: `<REPLACE with e.g., 0.10.2.3>`
 The one that comes with confluent 7. I think it is kafka 3.0.
 - [ ] librdkafka client configuration: `<REPLACE with e.g., message.timeout.ms=123, auto.reset.offset=earliest, ..>`
 kerberos authentication
 - [ ] Operating system: `<REPLACE with e.g., Centos 5 (x64)>`
 RHEL8

Suggested fix
============
Instead of calling system in rd_kafka_sasl_cyrus_kinit_refresh one could call a new function that librdkafka will have to implement. It would use the double-fork-technique such that kinit is run by a grandchild rather than a child. The grandchild can indicate completion to the parent using a standard unix/linux pipe. I asked chatGPT about this problem and it gave sample code for both aspects of the solution. They are reproduced in a simple example program below:

int main() {
    int pipefd[2];
    pipe(pipefd);

    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // First child process
        pid_t grandchild_pid = fork();
        if (grandchild_pid > 0) {
            // First child exits immediately
            exit(0);
        } else if (grandchild_pid == 0) {
            // Grandchild process
            close(pipefd[0]);  // Close the read end of the pipe
            // ... Perform some task here ...
            sleep(2); // Simulate some work

            // Notify parent of completion
            write(pipefd[1], ""done"", 4);
            close(pipefd[1]);  // Close the write end after writing
            exit(0);
        }
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);  // Wait for the first child

        // Now wait for the grandchild to complete
        char buffer[5] = {0};
        close(pipefd[1]);  // Close the write end of the pipe
        read(pipefd[0], buffer, 4);
        close(pipefd[0]);

        if (strncmp(buffer, ""done"", 4) == 0) {
            printf(""Grandchild has completed its task.\n"");
        }
    }

Hello guys, first of all thanks for this tool, this was literally what I’ve been looking for, thanks a lot.

I just found a behaviour, I might probably be setting up wrong on my config or something. Basically I have a workspace assigned to move to a specific monitor, with workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment and what happens is that, whenever I disconnect my monitor and I connect it again with the workspace I have assigned to force move, it will not move and will stay on the main monitor, even though I have it forced moved. If I have any other workspace focus on the moment I will connect the monitor again, then it works perfectly fine.

Am I missing some configuration or something?

thanks in advance…

Hi, while parsing the code I found that Google Analytics (GA) Ids are open even with Google Tag Manager ID (gtmId). It would be better if this is exported in a separate .env. As you have other environments.

ex: NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, NEXT_OPEN_PANEL_CLIENT_ID, etc.

It would be better if these Keys were not NEXT_PUBLIC, it violates the security part...

--- 

From ChatGPT when i'm asking why we won't use NEXT_PUBLIC for sensitive environment's

Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC are exposed to the client-side, making them accessible in the browser’s developer tools. This can be a security risk if you are handling sensitive data such as API keys, tokens, or database credentials. Any sensitive or private information should remain server-side and not be exposed to the client.

However, i've noticed a difference between how the function is implemented in this repo, and the definition in the article. In the article, the sin and cos terms are interleaved such that indexes corresponding to 2i are sin, and indexes corresponding to 2i + 1 are cos. In the code, afaict instead the cos terms are just appended to the sin terms rather than interleaved.

I figure maybe this doesn't matter and that the neural network / training process is indifferent to which position in the vector different terms are in? But i asked ChatGPT and it seemed to think it mattered a lot, so I thought it was at least worth an ask."

## Type of Change
Enhancement/Bug

## Summary
First of all, I just want to say what you're doing here is fantastic... this is awesome! I've got wcc working with SSR for completely native web components, using a custom renderer or lit-ssr, both with working client-side hydration.

My main issue is when setting properties using a custom renderer or lit-html's render (not LitElement) with template literals, element properties in rendered templates aren't passed down to child elements. This happens with both the light dom and shadow dom.

## Why is it happening?

I'm sure I'm missing a lot here, but I think this is happening because wcc is using .innerHTML instead of .appendChild/.childNodes when adding/retrieving child nodes which causes all element properties to be discarded. I notice the dom-shim for appendChild also uses innerHTML. Is there a way to shim appendChild that retains the element's properties? This is just a guess, but I believe that by using appendChild/childNodes with a true appendChild shim instead of innerHTML, you can retain all of the properties set by renderers like lit-ssr or custom renderers like the one below. It looks like with parse 5, you can just use childNodes.push to append children. Additionally, I put some chatGPT generated shims for appendChild, removeChild, etc. at the bottom of this request in case it's any help.

**This would be huge for web components because you could SSR or SSG entire intricate render templates, passing down complex objects, maps, sets, etc. to child components, rendering the initial state on the server, without setting dozens of attributes. This would allow for creating really interesting, reusable light dom and shadow dom web component systems that allow for a complex initial render that can be cached for performance but that become deeply reactive when the client side renderer hydrates the templates. It also makes the idea of complex, _isomorphic_, vanilla web components a reality which may seem impossible otherwise.**

Studying the wcc codebase, I'm sure this goes deeper than I understand but man, this would be really powerful. I'm hoping you can fill in the gaps and see a way to make this happen!

## Details
Here is a custom ssr renderer I'm using (with everything not related to this issue removed) but this can be tested with lit-ssr's render as well:

```javascript
import { parse } from 'node-html-parser';

const isFalsy = (str) => ['false', 'null', 'undefined', '0', '-0', 'NaN', '0n', '-0n'].includes(str);

export const render = (content, container, deps) => {
  const parsedContent = parse(content());
  const elements = parsedContent.getElementsByTagName('*');

  elements.forEach((element) => {
    const attributes = element.attributes;

    Object.entries(attributes).forEach(([attribute, value]) => {
      if (attribute.startsWith('.')) {
        const propName = attribute.substring(1);
        element.removeAttribute(attribute);
        element[propName] = deps?.[value] ?? value;
      }
    });
  });

  // This is using the wcc appendChild shim which I'm sure is part of the 
  // problem here since it just uses innerHTML
  if (container.shadowRoot) {
    const template = document.createElement('template');
    template.appendChild(parsedContent);
    container.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
  } else {
    container.appendChild(parsedContent);
  }
};
```

Example components:

```javascript
customElements.define(
  'parent-element',
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      const item = { message: 'Hello World' };
      this.test = 'This works';
      render(() => `<child-element .message=""${item.message}""></child-element><p>${this.test}</p>`, this);
    }
  }
);

customElements.define(
  'child-element',
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      render(() => `<p>${this.message}</p>`, this);
    }
  }
);

```

Here's how this renderer works passing down an object. Again, this doesn't work server side with wcc, but works once hydration kicks in:

```javascript
customElements.define(
  'parent-element',
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      const item = { message: 'Hello World' };
      this.test = 'This works';
      render(() => `<child-element .item=""item""></child-element><p>${this.test}</p>`, this, { item });
    }
  }
);

customElements.define(
  'child-element',
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      render(() => `<p>${this.item?.message}</p>`, this);
    }
  }
);
```

## What do I expect?

I would expect the paragraph tag to display ""Hello World"" on the server side render in both scenarios. The console.log in the render function shows that the element's message property is successfully being set server side.


## What actually happens?

The paragraph element in child-element displays ""undefined"" 

With the above components, ""This works"" does render server side with wcc which shows that element properties are renderable, they're just being lost somewhere when being passed to child elements.

Once the client renderer kicks in and the component is hydrated, things display as you would expect (""Hello World"").

What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance!

## Some chatGPT shims
Btw, here are some quick chatGPT shims for parentNode, childNodes, appendChild, and removeChild if it's any help:

```javascript
// parentNode shim
if (!Element.prototype.parentNode) {
  Object.defineProperty(Element.prototype, 'parentNode', {
    get: function () {
      return this._parentNode || null;
    },
    set: function (newParent) {
      this._parentNode = newParent;
    },
    configurable: true
  });
}

// childNodes shim
if (!Element.prototype.childNodes) {
  Object.defineProperty(Element.prototype, 'childNodes', {
    get: function () {
      this._childNodes = this._childNodes || [];
      return this._childNodes;
    },
    configurable: true
  });
}

// appendChild shim
if (!Element.prototype.appendChild) {
  Element.prototype.appendChild = function (child) {
    if (child.parentNode) {
      child.parentNode.removeChild(child); // Remove from current parent
    }

    // Ensure childNodes exists
    this.childNodes = this.childNodes || [];

    // Add child to childNodes array
    this.childNodes.push(child);

    // Update the child's parentNode
    child.parentNode = this;

    return child;
  };
}

// removeChild shim
if (!Element.prototype.removeChild) {
  Element.prototype.removeChild = function (child) {
    if (!this.childNodes || !this.childNodes.length) return null;

    const index = this.childNodes.indexOf(child);
    if (index === -1) return null;

    // Remove the child from the array
    this.childNodes.splice(index, 1);

    // Clear the child's parentNode reference
    child.parentNode = null;

    return child;
  };
}

Hello,

For technical reasons, I need to build using MinGW instead of MSVC. But compiling with MinGW instead of MSVC is not going ""smoothly"".

My English is not very good, so I’m using ChatGPT for translation. I apologize for any formatting errors or other issues.

**Describe the bug**
Debugging a JavaScript file which leverages [module.register](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#moduleregisterspecifier-parenturl-options) does end up in a infinite hang.
This issue is the same as[issue2009](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/2009), which was closed due to lack of a reproduction method. I have found a stable way to reproduce the issue.

**To Reproduce**
```js
//入口.js
import { register } from 'module'

console.log('print something');
register('anything') // hang up if has break point in this file
console.log('set break point here');
```
1. In VS Code, set a breakpoint on line 6 of`入口.js`
2. In the VS Code terminal (I'm using cmd), run `node --inspect ./入口.js`

**Log File**
N/A

**VS Code Version:** 1.94.2

**Additional context**


The key to reproducing this issue is **having Chinese characters in the file path of the file containing the breakpoint**,However, it seems that the length of the Chinese characters matters. For example,if `入口.js` is replaced with`入.js`or`口.js`, it outputs nothing and simply exits.

If the filename is in another language, such as `テスト.js` (Japanese), it also outputs nothing.

I tested this on two versions of Node (`v22.11.0` and `v18.20.4`), and the issue exists on both.

Hi. 
I started 2 days ago to check micro (never hear about it before) because i wanted to prepare my android phone to perform some small development.
I came across micro with plugin filemanager which is the unique (i think) text editor with a file picker and also split views. 
Immediately felt the need to have copilot as in my daily setup.

I created this plugin which is an initial idea.

https://gist.github.com/iGio90/f6f7c60bad824ae469cf65f9280ee493

the logic is: 
1) when a new character is added and its placed at the end of the line, we build a context which consist of all function signatures from opened files + the whole function body of the current function we are in
2) we push the context to copilot and get the response
3) the completion suggestion is added in the so called info bar
4) there is a key binding to add the result straight


This code has been built by 99% from chatgpt as i never wrote a line of lua in my entire life. (We can discuss in other channels about the choice of using this language xD)
Anyway, im not really happy about it. I asked chatgpt to make it async, it gave me some output which doesn't look to work, but its an initial solution.

Im sharing the code on a gist in the hope that someone with better experience with lua can jump in and help with the development.

How to use it, since currently the whole login part is missing.
1) pull this repo https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-api
2) run the ``api.py`` and follow instruction to login
3) after login, a file named ``.copilot_token`` is created in the same dir
4) create a folder ``~/.config/micro/plug/copilot`` and move inside the .copilot_token and the content of my gist saved to copilot.lua
5) download https://github.com/rxi/json.lua/blob/master/json.lua and save it as well to ``~/.config/micro/plug/copilot``

the plugin will perform the api call through curl (chatgpt told me there is no proper way with lua to perform http request so it just used shell + curl) on each rune added at the end of line, it will display the hint and give you ability to apply it

Hi Brandon and Tanvi!

**branch name:** _same branch as your previous ticket_

For this week, we want you to integrate your daily calendar view that you worked on last week with the backend. There are a lot of moving parts in this sprint, so please read the entire ticket carefully before starting!

**Task:**

- To start, we want to add some additional props inside `frontend/app/components/atoms/BoxText/index.tsx`. Add a prop named `meetingId` of type `string` and a prop named 'onClick' of type `(meetingId: string) => void`. Under the return for the BoxText within the parent `div`, add an attribute `onClick={() => onClick(meetingId)}`. These changes will eventually become very important once we make the blocks clickable, as we'll need to be able to display all the expanded details for each meeting. _Note that there may be other parts of your code that still assume an old implementation of the BoxText component, so you may want to fix those errors as they come up._ 

Now, it's time to connect to the backend. Implement your work inside of your  `/organisms/DailyView/index.tsx` component.
- By default, the view should display all of the meetings for the **_current day_**, as determined by the user's machine. You should make use of the React `useState` hook to manage the selected day. It will also be a good idea to use `useState` to store the meetings for the given day. 
- Implement a function `fetchMeetingsByDay` which will call the API endpoint for getting all the meetings by the selected day. An example of this API call is included inside of `frontend/app/test/page.tsx`.
- You'll want to implement a function such as `handleDateChange` to manage when the date changes. Upon this happening, you should call `fetchMeetingsByDay` and update the state for the meetings and the day. You also want to make use of the React `useEffect` hook to call `handleDateChange` upon the initial render (so that the Calendar does not appear empty by default).
- Eventually, the user should be able to cycle forward and backward through the dates freely. However, notice that this will lead to many redundant API calls if they are viewing the same day multiple times. Therefore, we want to optimize our system by utilizing **_caching_**. You should initialize some sort of cache like `const meetingCache = new Map();`. Anytime `fetchMeetingsByDay` is called, it should first look into the cache to check if the meetings for the given date have previously been loaded and stored in the cache. If so, it should immediately return those. Otherwise, it should make the API call as necessary and store the meetings in the cache before returning.
- For now, do not worry about how to actually cycle through the dates. That will be for a future ticket.
- I know that was a lot of info, so to help get you started, I've put some generic starter code generated by ChatGPT at the bottom of this ticket. You can use this as a starting point or as clarification in case anything I described above was confusing (but be cautious about copying things directly, particularly for the API call). _Do NOT worry_ about `handlePreviousDay` or `handleNextDay` for now; that functionality will be for a future ticket:

**Testing:**

- Test your component by adding it to the relevant div within `/app/components/templates/HomePageLayout.tsx` and checking that it displays all the meetings properly for the current day.
- You may need to add some fake meetings to the database to test with. MongoDB Compass will come in handy for this.
- Take a screenshot of the working component and attach it to your PR.

**Starter code:**
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const meetingCache = new Map();

const fetchMeetingsByDay = async (date) => {
  if (meetingCache.has(date)) {
    // Use cached data if available
    return meetingCache.get(date);
  }

  // Fetch data from API if not in cache
  const response = await fetch(`/api/retrieve/meeting/day?date=${date}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  // Store data in cache
  meetingCache.set(date, data);

  return data;
};

const Calendar = () => {
  const [meetings, setMeetings] = useState([]);
  const [currentDate, setCurrentDate] = useState(getTodayDate());

  // Function to get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  function getTodayDate() {
    const today = new Date();
    return today.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  }

  // Load meetings for the current date on initial render
  useEffect(() => {
    handleDateChange(currentDate);
  }, []);

  // Fetch and update meetings when the date changes
  const handleDateChange = async (date) => {
    const data = await fetchMeetingsByDay(date);
    setMeetings(data);
    setCurrentDate(date);
  };

  // Navigate to the previous day
  const handlePreviousDay = () => {
    const prevDate = new Date(currentDate);
    prevDate.setDate(prevDate.getDate() - 1);
    handleDateChange(prevDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
  };

  // Navigate to the next day
  const handleNextDay = () => {
    const nextDate = new Date(currentDate);
    nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + 1);
    handleDateChange(nextDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handlePreviousDay}>Previous Day</button>
        <span>{currentDate}</span>

I'll try to explain my problem the best I can.

I installed otpmanager to my nextcloud aio running via docker. Never opened the app on my browser. But I then installed the Android app as I wanted to check it out. I could login with my fingerprint. So no worries there. But when I wanted to login to the app on my browser, it asks me for a password that I have never set.
I asked chatgpt and it said ""your description matches the logic used in the provided code"".

I would really love to use this app. But it only has advantage over authenticator if I also can use it on my pc/laptop/browser.
Is there anything to get a fix for this? "

Heya, @jaumeortola , @susanaboatto and @p-goulart ,

I know you are very busy, but this is an issue that involves the Premium version of LanguageTool.

This disambiguator rule breaks the Premium version:

```
    <rule> <!-- Used ChatGPT 4o to verify the 3217 results -->
      <pattern>
        <token postag=""V.+"" postag_regexp=""yes""><exception postag_regexp='yes' postag='CS|RG|NC.+|AQ.+|CC|SPS.+|[DP].+'/></token>

Could one of you make changes in Premium so that I may implement it?

Hi

You deprecated the old json format. So the replay data cannot be read. I asked ChatGPT to create a script in bash which does the conversion of the old replaydata in the folder. I thought I'll share it with you, if you wanna somehow implement this logic in a new plugin release or let people help themselves (hopefully they use Linux).

Hi,
Here below my request generated by ChatGPT (I'm dot a developer):

I would like to request the implementation of a feature that allows direct pixel manipulation on the AWTRIX display through MQTT. Specifically, this feature could be implemented as a matrix property in MQTT payloads, enabling users to define the position and color of individual pixels programmatically.

For example:

```
{
  ""duration"": 5,
  ""matrix"": [
    {""x"": 0, ""y"": 0, ""color"": ""#FF0000""},
    {""x"": 1, ""y"": 0, ""color"": ""#00FF00""},
    {""x"": 2, ""y"": 0, ""color"": ""#0000FF""}
  ]
}
```
Use Case: This feature would open up new possibilities for creative and dynamic displays, such as:

Displaying custom animations or progress bars.
Visualizing real-time data, like energy usage or temperature trends, directly as a grid of colors or patterns.
Allowing greater control over the AWTRIX display for users who want to go beyond text and icons.
Benefits:

Enhanced Customization: Users can create dynamic, pixel-perfect displays for specific use cases without relying on pre-designed icons.
Compatibility: This aligns AWTRIX’s functionality with modern LED matrix frameworks, which often support pixel-level control.
Community Engagement: This feature could attract more users and contributors who are looking for highly flexible, programmable displays.
Proposed Implementation:

Add a matrix field to the custom MQTT payload specification.
Allow the matrix array to define:
x: Horizontal position (0–7 for an 8x8 matrix).
y: Vertical position (0–7 for an 8x8 matrix).
color: Pixel color in HEX format (e.g., #FF0000 for red).
Combine this property with duration and icon/text fields, ensuring backward compatibility with existing functionality.
Example Payload: To display a single row of blue pixels:

```
{
  ""duration"": 5,
  ""matrix"": [
    {""x"": 0, ""y"": 6, ""color"": ""#0000FF""},
    {""x"": 1, ""y"": 6, ""color"": ""#0000FF""},
    {""x"": 2, ""y"": 6, ""color"": ""#0000FF""}
  ]
}
```
Potential Challenges:

Compatibility with existing rendering logic.
Memory or processing constraints for handling real-time pixel data.
Conclusion: Direct pixel control would be a highly valuable addition to AWTRIX’s feature set, enabling advanced display options for power users and developers. This would also keep AWTRIX competitive with alternative smart LED matrix solutions.

Thank you for considering this request! Please let me know if I can provide further details or examples."

**Problem Statement**

I am surprised we do not have a nice good tool to show the `path` to the match. 

I asked chatgpt and it told me to try `xq 'path(.. | select(. == ""your_search_value""))' file.xml` and obviously that did not work since there seems to be no such ""advanced"" search options in `xq`.

I wondered if there could be some ""search"" mode which also would depict the path to the hit or may be you would recommend alternatives?

Thanks in advance."

### Bug description

[Copied from thread I made in the official Discord:](https://discord.com/channels/952946952348270622/1308305076921827328)

> I have a Blackview MEGA 1 tablet and get the toast error upon YT startup ""SponsorBlockViewController: initialize failure"", causing the ""Skip button"" option of SB to not function (no buttons shown) and SB to have no buttons at all when attempting to contribute. It seems to be specific to Blackview devices due to the OEM-customized ROM. My device is rooted with Magisk, but disabling all modules and app root access does not fix the problem. A search on 4PDA (Russian analogue of XDA-Developers) reveals others experiencing the issue on Blackview devices: https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?act=search&source=all&forums%5B%5D=all&query=sponsorblockviewcontroller&x=23&y=12&subforums=1
> 
> Here's the logcat: https://pastebin.com/ZrkxzH7d
> I attempted to use ChatGPT to find a fix; I'm not yet experienced with building in java to test it. It blames a class mismatch with the drawable being called by SB RippleDrawable and the ROM only having StateListDrawable. https://github.com/acidcitrus/revanced-patches/commit/a2fc1bccc44cdb21c9dc3e07e70ffae03f32066c

**Describe the bug**

I tried to use chatgpt to generate serverpod model files for a new app. I teached serverpod with the 
https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod_docs/blob/main/docs/06-concepts/02-models.md

and my app idea. 

Chatgpt generated a bunch of .spy.yaml files which are looking good but makes serverpod generate crash with
Concurrent modification during iteration: Instance(length:17) of '_GrowableList'.

To simplify things it tried generate only the code for one this model files (I know that generated model files are not correct,
but it would be lovely to get an error message instead of an exception)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. serverpod create myapp

2. cd myapp;cd myapp_server

3. create inside lib/src/models/user.spy.yaml 
class: User
table: users
fields:
  id: int, isPrimaryKey, autoIncrement
  username: String, unique
  email: String, unique
  displayName: String
  calendarEvents: List<CalendarEvent>, relation
  createdAt: DateTime, default=now
  updatedAt: DateTime, default=now

4. serverpod generate
5. See error

Stack-Trace:
Yikes! It is possible that this error is caused by an internal issue with the Serverpod tooling.
We would appreciate if you filed an issue over at Github. Please include the stack trace below and
describe any steps you did to trigger the error.

**Expected behavior**
Instead of an exception I except to get an error message.

I figured out, the main reason for this exception is this:
calendarEvents: List<CalendarEvent>, relation

Deleting ""List"" from the line and I get an error message instead of the exception.

I'm working my way through _Statistical Rethinking_ and have run into some trouble running the models in the bonus material of the 2023 lecture 12. I initially had a lot of trouble replicating the posteriors shown on the slides, but that may be due to sampling differences since we're not using a ```set.seed()```. However, when I attempted to run the ""full luxury Bayes"" model at the end of the bonus material, Stan couldn't run the model at all.

Before attempting to run the chains, I got an error message saying, ""line 27, column 8: Unreachable
    statement (following a reject, fatal_error, break, continue, or return)
    found, is this intended?""

The code at line 27, column 8 of the Stan text file is the next line after a return line, which from what I gather from ChatGPT is part of the problem: Stan can't run two different returns as it terminates after the first return. Here is the Stan code I'm seeing:
```
        return normal_lpdf( X | mu , sigma ); // line 26
        for ( i in 1:size(Y) ) {
            p[i] = a[g[start+i-1]] + bxy * X[start+i-1] + bzy * Z[g[start+i-1]] + buy * u[g[start+i-1]];
            p[i] = inv_logit(p[i]);
        }
        return bernoulli_lpmf( Y | p );
```

Once the code tried to run, it produced these errors: ""Chain 1 Unrecoverable error evaluating the log probability at the initial value.
Chain 1 Exception: Exception: normal_lpdf: Random variable has size = 200, but Location parameter has size 1; and they must be the same size."" It also referred to line 27, and then referred to this section of the Stan code as well:

I don't know anything about CSS of this type, so I asked ChatGPT what to do and here's what chat said...the last one (OPTION B) seems to make the most sense to me, and it's easier to understand in the CSS. I went ahead and made the required changes to the Rollup script. You would only need to change the CSS.

Dear Alexandra,
When I ran agora-vertebrates.py, the ancGenes.log showed that 'Traceback (most recent call last):File ""/public/xxx/Agora/Agora-master/src/ALL.reformatGeneFamilies.py"", line 91, in <module>  raise AssertionError(""Duplicated genes in the orthology group"") 
  AssertionError: Duplicated genes in the orthology group' so I used 'sort orthologyGroups.<species>.list | uniq -d' to check and delete the duplicate gene names in my orthologous group file. After that I ran it again,the same problem occured. So I asked ChatGPT and add some debugging information in the  ALL.reformatGeneFamilies.py like 
'for og in orthologyGroups:
    n += 1
    if len(og) != len(set(og)):
        print(f""Duplicated genes in orthology group {n}: {og}"", file=sys.stderr)
        raise AssertionError(""Duplicated genes in the orthology group"")'.
  After trying again, the ancGenes.log still showed the same as before, meanwhile output some possible ID in the log like'Updating the ancestral families of N0 ... adding names ...

### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Describe the bug

The following is on an Azure VM with Windows Server 2022.
Versions: App is at .netCore 7.0
Asp Net Core hosting bundle installed: 3.1.14
We had a WebSocket issue, it stopped working and refused to work, we spent weeks trying to find the issue in the end gave up and decided to completely re-install IIS. The web app was working fine in IIS it was only the websockets not working.
I exported backup of IIS configuration, also backup the C:\windows\system32\inetsrv\config folder.
I removed the IIS features, restarted the VM.
I then added IIS features back in.
In IIS the URL re-write module was now missing so I added that again.
Re-created the AppPool and sites again.
The website did not work, It was giving an error on the web.config section
```
<system.webServer>
    <handlers>
        <add name=""aspNetCore"" path=""*"" verb=""*"" modules=""AspNetCoreModuleV2"" resourceType=""Unspecified"" />
    </handlers>
    <aspNetCore processPath=""dotnet"" arguments="".\MyApp.dll"" stdoutLogEnabled=""false"" stdoutLogFile="".\logs\stdout"" hostingModel=""inprocess"" />
</system.webServer>
```

I then realize the AspNetCoreModuleV2 is not loaded in the IIS module, I did a Google abd found posts stating I must repare hosting bundle, which I did, about 100 time by now. But it did not fix the issue.

The app is a .Net Core 7.0 app. This is installed, SDK as Runtime, here is the dotnet --info listing:

I have uninstalled AspNetCoreModuleV2 100 times with these commands:
`>Appcmd.exe uninstall module AspNetCoreModuleV2`

`appcmd.exe install module /name:AspNetCoreModuleV2 /image:""C:\Program Files\IIS\Asp.Net Core Module\V2\aspnetcorev2.dll""`

After the uninstall I will repair the hosting bundle, or sometimes uninstall it and install again. I reset iis, restart the VM 100 times.

The website does not run I get error 500 in Chrome with message ""Failed to laod response data: No resource with given identifier found""

In the Event Viewer I get this message:

What I observe is in the backup of C:\windows\system32\inetsrv\config\schema that there used to be a file aspnetcore_schema_v2.xml which is no longer in the new C:\windows\system32\inetsrv\config\schema folder of the new installation.

Other things I have tried:
I went onto this page https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/hosting-bundle?view=aspnetcore-7.0
Followed the link there to the [NET Core Hosting Bundle installer (direct download)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/permalink/dotnetcore-current-windows-runtime-bundle-installer).
From there follow it to the older versions on this page https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet and here select ""Out of support versions"" then get the .Net Core 7.0 installation and from there select the Windows x64 installation, download and install that.
Previously we used the .Net Core hosting bundle 3.14 (which is what another colelague wrote down in the installation notes they installed), as I mention above I downloaded also that and re-sintalled several time.

I have Google extensively read everything I can, asked ChatGPT in several ways, everybody says check the module is installed in IIS, which it is, and to repair hosting bundle, which I did 100 times.

I also added line
`<section name=""aspNetCore"" overrideModeDefault=""Allow"" />`
in the applicationHost.config under section `<sectionGroup name=""system.webServer"">`

This has been taking us days and wasting soooo much time! I HAVE to get this working!

232,679b6a5fcbe8284d7a731779,issue,documentation -> generating release note,https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/6025,"Release notes generation tools
One thing that takes quite a bit of time for me on each release is the generation of release notes.

I like to keep each entry as detailed yet in the most concise manner possible so that someone randomly hopping in could quickly get a gist of the changes that have gone in that particular release. I try to use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate the same by feeding it the relevant context like the issue, MR links amd get the relevant release notesand give it a final polish before settling on the release notes entry.

It becomes tedious when there are several chanhes and it is a mundane task for sure. I wanted to start this thread to know if anyone here is aware of amy tool that could potentially automate this process. 🙂 

Note: I do use the changelog generated by GitHub's 'Generate release notes' feature as a starting point. It unfortunately requires to tag the release for the same to work. As I wish for the release notes to be present in our Changelog file before tagging the release, it gets a bit tricky. So, if you're aware of tools that could help do the job of GitHub's release note generation that would be helpful too. Do share them here."
233,679b6a5fcbe8284d7a731798,issue,software quality -> testing -> generating test data,https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j/issues/1240,"LSMA Indicator calculation result into incorrect values 

Describe the bug
---------------
The `LSMAIndicator` implementation in the current snapshot (0.18-SNAPSHOT) 
version calculates incorrect values for the Least Squares Moving Average (LSMA). When tested with a specific dataset, the results do not match the expected values.

The discrepancy is evident when using the `LSMAIndicator` with:
- Bar Count: 20
- Offset: 0

The results deviate from the expected LSMA values in the provided `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv` file.

To Reproduce
------------
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Clone the `ta4j` repository and build the snapshot version.
2. Use the `LSMAIndicator` with the following parameters:
   - `barCount = 20`
   - `offset = 0`
3. Apply the indicator to the dataset in the attached `NIFTY_50_04112024_11122024.csv`.
4. Compare the calculated LSMA values against the expected values in `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv`.

Expected behavior
-----------------
The calculated LSMA values should align with the data in the `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv` file for the given dataset.

Attached Files
--------------
- `NIFTY_50_04112024_11122024.csv`: The dataset used for testing.
- `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv`: The correct LSMA values for comparison.

Additional Context
------------------
1. Problem Details: ""As suggested by ChatGPT"" Not sure about it but it generated correct csv matching the broker/exchange data on the subset provided
   - The `LSMAIndicator` implementation does not correctly calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line. This causes the LSMA values to deviate from the expected output.
   - The issue might involve inaccuracies in how the `sx` (time-weighted sum of price deviations) and `sy` (time-weighted sum of time deviations) are computed or applied in the final formula.

2. Verification:
   - The correct LSMA values provided in `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv` were generated using ChatGPT for testing purposes. However, the exact source of the discrepancy in the current implementation is not identified.

Suggested Fix or Workaround
---------------------------
The `LSMAIndicator` logic for slope and intercept calculation may need to be reviewed. The correct formula has been independently verified and can be cross-checked against the `NIFTY_50_with_LSMA.csv`.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Review the regression calculation in the `LSMAIndicator`, particularly the slope (`sx`) and intercept logic, for potential inaccuracies.

I'm not a programmer, I asked ChatGPT what to do, it told me to add ""`uppercase-text`"" to the field's Element Class and then add ""`.uppercase-text input {text-transform:uppercase;}`"" to the additional CSS part.
But that doesn't turn lowercase into uppercase unfortunately, and seeing as I've got no CSS knowledge or experience, I don't know what to do about it.

Hello,
I’ve been using your addon for a very long time because I’m French, and it’s very useful for us French people. However, I’d like to share some improvement ideas for the addon.

- In the ""Discover"" section, add a category called ""Category"" to search film by genre (horror, comedy, drama, thriller, etc.).
- And, besides the popular Movies/Series on the homepage, a category for trending Movies/Series and also a category for recent Movies/Series? These same categories could also be used in the Discover tab instead of just having Movies and Series available. Do you understand what I mean? (I’m using ChatGPT to translate this, so I hope it’s correct.)

Here screenshot to understand more what i want to mean :
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e879d33a-23b0-48ed-a593-02ded2573e3a)
On the **red circle** here, you can add Trend/Recent/populare Film/Serie and so we can search with other category 
On the **blue circle** you can add here the first idea i speak
And in the **green circle** you can switch some of the option in the blue circle and add another

For now, I only have these two ideas, but I think it’s already a lot of work. If you agree to add them, I might submit other ideas in the future that could interest you.

Thank you in advance :D

### Current behavior?

I am a beginner and encountering an issue while trying to run TensorFlow locally using Anaconda in VS Code. The same code runs smoothly on Google Colab, but when executed locally, it fails during the dataset download process with the following error.

What I've Tried
Re-downloading TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets to ensure they are up to date.
Manually Unzipping the Dataset and verifying if 'PetImages/Cat/0.jpg' exists in the archive.
Re-adjusting Python, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Datasets Versions to match those in Colab by using Python 3.10.11 instead of Python 3.10.12.
Recreating the Virtual Environment in Anaconda to ensure a clean setup.
Downloading the Cats vs Dogs Dataset from Different Sources, but the issue persists.
Asking ChatGPT for assistance, but the issue remains unresolved.

Additional Information
On Google Colab, the same code runs without any issues, and the dataset downloads successfully.
In VS Code, the error consistently occurs during the dataset download process, indicating that 'PetImages/Cat/0.jpg' is missing from the archive.
Network Stability: I have a stable internet connection, and downloads complete without interruption, but the error persists.

Questions
Why does the KeyError occur in VS Code but not in Google Colab?
Could this be related to the way the dataset is being downloaded or unzipped locally?
Are there any compatibility issues between the Python/TensorFlow versions and the dataset?
Request for Help
I would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue. Thank you in advance for your assistance!

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description about the issue you encounter.

I can no longer ssh into raspiblitz on raspberry pi 5. I always get a connection refused message.
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior.
![IMG_4720](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe42ec28-9353-4345-b1b3-7d3d50070115)

I was having issues with some of the applications not working and used ChatGPT to try and address them (checking channels using raspiblitz menu in command didn’t work, loop not working in RTL, among other things). Chatgpt somewhat buggered it up more so I decided I would start over. Backed up my LND and reflashed the SD card. After booting I was able to ssh in once, and then after that I get the connection refused message. 
-I have attempted adding an ssh file with no extension to the boot partition.
-I have turned off firewall and tried again with no luck.
-I have tried booting with an external monitor plugged in but I only get system status messages (pictures
 is attached) and the keyboard doesn’t do anything (using a Bluetooth usb for keyboard) so I can’t do anything with a command line.
-I was able to access the Web UI but now I’m stuck on waitsync with the note of provision done. I wasn’t able to backup my LND again so the backup is probably a day or so old.

I’m fine with starting over except that I have funds on the lightning network that I don’t want to lose. I went into the SSD and copied off the app-data folder and the lnd folder but I’m afraid to wipe the SSD and SD to start over in risk of losing the funds.

Hello everyone!
Thank you in advance for the space to share and solve the problems and for your time in reading them.

I'm just starting out in programming and I'm trying something (which I understand isn't possible at the moment) but I'm sharing my doubts in case there's someone else out there with the same problem (or solution).

I am trying to connect an extra 3rd screen (in extension mode) to my HP 15ay notebook with Kali Linux as operating system (it only has one HDMI port to which I have a 2nd screen connected that works correctly and I only have USB 2.0 ports available...It also doesn't have USB C ports), via a VGA/USB 3.0 connector, knowing their incompatibilities and limitations...

The adapter is  (lsusb) ""Bus 002 Device 002: ID 1d5c:2000 Fresco Logic FL2000/FL2000DX VGA/DVI/HDMI Adapter"" (which I understand is compatible with Kali Linux but I have problems with the drivers).

I installed the Driver for Fresco Logic FL2000, downloaded and installed the necessary dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential dkms linux-headers-linux-headers-6.11.2-rt-amd64

I cloned the driver repository

git clone https://github.com/FrescoLogic/FL2000.git

but it doesn't recognize the monitor and I can't compile...

I installed and edited the Kernel headers and the ""Makefile"" file

nano Makefile
KERNEL_PATH = /usr/src/linux-headers-linux-headers-6.11.2-rt-amd64

and when compiling the Kernel module and trying to load the module by running ""make"", it does not generate the file called fl2000.ko.
I understand It is necessary to adjust the driver code to be compatible with my kernel version...

After being able to solve almost all the errors (EXCEPT ONE!) with the help of chatgpt (such as problems associated with the get_user_pages, mmap_sem, vm_map_ram functions), modifying the fl2000_surface.c file, I understand that the problem I need to solve is with the ""flags"" (vm_flags) that are not defined or available in my kernel version...yet!

I wanted to know if there is an updated version of the driver code (FL2000) compatible with my kernel (since I don't want to compile it with an older version..)


So this is the error I get when running ""make"":

Hello everyone,
I'm Zeynep. I'm trying to design an experiment for my master's thesis. Unfortunately I don't know Javascript. So I'm struggling a little bit finding my way through lab.js.
Basically I want to know how to randomly assign participants to two conditions on lab.js.

To better explain myself I want to mention my experiment.
Simply there are 2 conditions: Anger and Sadness. I want half of the participant to see Anger condition but not Sadness, and the other half vice versa; to see Sadness condition but not Anger. 

So I build my hierarchy as follows:

Main_Loop
   a. Anger_Loop
         Sequence
            Page1
            Page2
            Page3
            Page4
   b. Sadness_Loop
         Sequence
            Page1
            Page2
            Page3
            Page4

In Main_Loop Content section:
I wrote Anger_Loop to parameter0 and Sadness_Loop to parameter1
In the line below I wrote again Anger_Loop and Sadness Loop.
I wrote ""1"" to sample box and chose 'Sampled without replacement (in blocks)'

I tried to get help from ChatGPT and it gave me some codes but it didn't work. It shows Anger_Loop in every trial. 
The scripts I tried:

const sequence = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'Anger_Loop' : 'Sadness_Loop';
console.log('selected loop:', sequence);
return sequence;

------------------------------------------

const sequence = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'Anger_Loop' : 'Sadness_Loop';
return sequence;
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    return 'Anger_Loop';
} else {
    return 'Sadness_Loop';
}


Can you see where the mistake is? What can I do?

I'd appreciate your help. Thanks in advance!"

### Analysis and Attempt to Resolve Website Scraping Errors

Out of curiosity and professional interest, I attempted to scrape the entire company's support website (customer knowledgebase) but encountered the following error:

```
RuntimeError: Failed to fetch 'https://xxxxx/': Error accessing https://xxxxx/: Forbidden (403) for https://xxxx/
```

I can provide the full URL to any developer interested in addressing this issue, as it pertains to my company's public customer support website hosted on ZenDesk behind Cloudflare as I suppose based on headers). However, I prefer not to share it publicly here.

Response headers from curl (obfuscated a bit):
```
< x-zendesk-origin-server: app-server-xxxx-xxxx
< x-zendesk-processed-host-header: xxxx
< X-Zendesk-Zorg: yes
< Set-Cookie: __cf_bm=xxxx; path=/; expires=Mon, 06-Jan-25 23:14:31 GMT; domain=xxxx; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None
< Report-To: {""endpoints"":[{""url"":""https:\/\/xxxx.cloudflare.com\/report\/v4?s=xxxx""}],""group"":""xxxx"",""max_age"":604800}
< NEL: {""success_fraction"":0.01,""report_to"":""xxxx"",""max_age"":604800}
< Set-Cookie: __cfruid=xxxx; path=/; domain=xxxx; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None
< Set-Cookie: _cfuvid=xxxx; path=/; domain=xxxx; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None
< Server: cloudflare
```

### Initial Observations

Interestingly, a simple `curl` request worked without issue:

```
curl -L -v https://xxxxx/ -A ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36""
```

Even with basic headers, the request succeeded:

```
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
> Accept: */*
```

### Debugging and Modifications

I began troubleshooting `/backend/onyx/connectors/web/connector.py` to identify the root cause. My initial modification involved adding **User-Agent** and **Accept** headers to all `requests.get` calls:

```python
headers = {
    ""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"",
    ""Accept"": ""*/*""
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

Unfortunately, this change did not resolve the issue. The function `check_internet_connection` still returned the same **403 Forbidden** error when fetching the first URL.

### Playwright Integration

Suspecting that `requests` was insufficient to bypass the restrictions, I used ChatGPT to refactor `/backend/onyx/connectors/web/connector.py` to leverage **Playwright**. The idea was to utilize Playwright's browser mimics to bypass restrictions.

However, the problem persisted, and the **403 Forbidden** error continued to occur.

### Intercepting and Analyzing Headers

I hypothesized that Playwright might still be sending headers that Cloudflare identified as ""bot-like."" To investigate further, I intercepted and logged all headers with the following code:

```python
page.on(""request"", lambda request: print(f""Request headers for {request.url}: {request.headers}""))
```

This revealed some suspicious headers that Playwright added by default to mimic a browser more effectively:

```
{'sec-ch-ua': '""Not A(Brand"";v=""99"", ""HeadlessChrome"";v=""121"", ""Chromium"";v=""121""', 
 'sec-ch-ua-mobile': '?0', 
 'sec-ch-ua-platform': '""Linux""'}
```

These headers likely triggered Cloudflare's detection mechanisms.

### Header Interception and Customization

Using ChatGPT's suggestions, I implemented a method to intercept and customize headers for outgoing requests. This approach replaced the problematic headers while retaining critical ones like **User-Agent**. The modified code is as follows:

```python
page.route(""**/*"", lambda route, request: route.continue_(
    headers={
        ""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"",
        ""Accept"": ""text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"",
        ""Accept-Language"": ""en-US,en;q=0.9"",
        ""Connection"": ""keep-alive"",
    }
))
```

(Note: The **Accept** header, while seemingly unnecessary, was included based on ChatGPT's recommendations and left unchanged since the code works as intended.)

### Current State and Next Steps

Currently, I have a functional prototype inspired by ChatGPT, but the code is not well-polished. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could thoroughly review and refine this implementation before integrating it into production. The concept is effective, but the code requires significant improvements. Apologies for its current state.

**Describe the bug**
Easiest to describe by an example:
1. Press Caps Lock to show the flyout - flyout should be visible for, e.g., 3 seconds
2. Press Caps Lock while the flyout is shown - the 3-second timer should reset here, but it doesn't.

This is inconvenient, especially when you press the Caps Lock just before the timer expires (e.g., at 2.8 seconds). The disappear animation has already started, and the update isn't even visible at that point.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 11
 - Version [e.g. v1.2.2]

**Additional context**
I haven't worked with C# and WPF, but I took the time to look at the code for showing the flyout, specifically the unit `LockWindows.xaml.cs`. Since I'm not familiar with the implemented mechanisms, I asked ChatGPT to alter the behavior to work as described above. This was his response:
```cs
/*
  Solution
  To properly reset the timer and ensure the behavior you want, you can enforce proper cancellation and waiting for the previous execution to complete before starting a new one.
  
  Here’s how you can fix it:
  
  Track the active task and ensure it completes or cancels properly.
  Use a lock to prevent overlapping executions.
  
  Key Changes:
  activeTask: Tracks the currently running task for ShowLockFlyout.
  lockObj: Ensures thread safety when managing cts and activeTask.
  Cancel and Restart: The method waits for the previous task to be canceled or completes the cancellation before starting a new one.
  
  Benefits:
  Timer Resets: Calling ShowLockFlyout again before the previous execution completes will now cancel the previous instance and reset the timer properly.
  Thread Safety: Ensures no overlapping logic even if ShowLockFlyout is called concurrently from different threads.

    {
        cts.Cancel(); // Cancel the previous task
        cts = new CancellationTokenSource(); // Create a new CancellationTokenSource
        var token = cts.Token;

        // If there's an active task, wait for it to complete

            try

245,679b769ccbe8284d7a7322c1,issue,software quality -> fixing -> supporting debugging,https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/issues/2352,"freejoint seemingly stuck at 0 0 0
### Intro

Hello -

I am a researcher at OHSU, I use MuJoCo for my research on animals.  I got a bit stuck made a simple bot in Blender, and hopefully can get unstuck so thanks in advance for your help! I've scoured the documentation about freejoints and ChatGPT and Claude.ai were not able to help resolve this, I think I need another set of eyes because I bet this is a simple fix.


### My setup

mujoco-3.2.6
python 3.12.4
macOS 13.7.1


### What's happening? What did you expect?

I tried to set the freejoint to the center of mass in a simple bot I made in Blender. But I'm unable to set the freejoint to any position except 0 0 0, unless I configure the body/meshes to be at opposite locations. 

For example, this XML block:
<img width=""699"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 11 57 30"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d86d9830-8a34-4c32-ad34-c4545cf8774e"" />

Yields this result in the UI:
<img width=""419"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 11 29 15"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e42fd7e-597b-452c-b7aa-7e50ff0076e6"" />

As I understand it, the freejoint should be in the COM of the mesh with this configuration. However, I'm only able to get the freejoint to the COM by changing the XML tags to be in very offset positions, like this:

<img width=""695"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 12 04 29"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d72a40c4-9495-4945-baa5-463535f389fd"" />

which results:

<img width=""420"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 12 15 40"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f033cc-cd5d-4272-8dab-273ee4b9c215"" />

I have pored over the documentation and asked ChatGPT but I must be missing something. As I understand it, the freejoint should be in the COM of the body it lives under, so setting it to 0 0 0 should ideally make it coincident with the origin of the mesh, which is correctly defined in Blender.  Or potentially I'm missing a very important detail somewhere to make this work strangely. 

### Steps for reproduction

1. Load the model + the .stl file in the .zip.
2. change the pos values as defined in the XML to/ 0 0 0 and/or pos=""-.596 -0.15516 2.775"" or pos=""0.5 0 -2.775"".
3. Try to position the freejoint within the COM of the mesh/body.

### Describe the issue

@alexander0042 You mentioned that you had converted the JavaScript translations library to python locally but I don't think its been moved to the development endpoint right? I ask because the development endpoint went down shortly after you restarted it last week.

I did update the [translations repo](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/translations) with the code snippets from ChatGPT and finished up the other languages. The repository is on PyPI and is added as a requirement so should be easy to update your code to use that repo.

From ChatGPT

> The error occurs because PHP no longer allows assigning a reference (&) directly to the return value of a function. The specific problematic line is:

ChatGPT want to change the function like this:

### Minecraft Version

1.20.1

### The Issue

I created a custom model for the Kobolds! mod in Blender 3.6. I was able to succesfully import the model and armature into the Datapack Editor, but after I try to get into the animation select menu by clicking into the magnifiyng glass icon, the games crashes giving me this issue's title. I'll place the crash log and my model here. I asked ChatGPT about it, and it most likely is an error with animations, but I couldn't tell, I'm new to all this.

[crash-2025-01-20_16.44.34-client.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18526123/crash-2025-01-20_16.44.34-client.txt)

[kobolds.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18526126/kobolds.json)

### Steps to Reproduce

At Blender:
+ Select Model and Armature -> Export it with the json addon -> having all squares ticked or excluding animations export didn't make any difference

At Minecraft:
+ Import the json file -> choosing my custom model and armature -> hovering over to Living Animations -> add category and clicking the magnifying glass to open the animations menu -> crash"

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I’d like to contribute a small CSS fix for the built-in themes. I noticed that when a new notification is present, the icon badge next to the bell remains the default YouTube red color, which doesn’t align with the theme. It would be great if this could be updated to match the theme's styling.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I don’t have a lot of experience with CSS, but I know the basics. By inspecting the element, I found the CSS class `yt-spec-icon-badge-shape__badge`. I believe this class could be set to one of the colors from the chosen theme.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Initially, I wanted to address this as a custom theme fix but realized that I would need to choose between a built-in variant or my custom CSS theme. Then, I considered creating a Tampermonkey script to fix it, but I thought it would be worth bringing up here first.

**Additional context**
I did use ChatGPT to rewrite what I said above. I type like a dumbass and I wanted my issue to be concise.
I would love to contribute my own fix, but I cannot find any repo with all the theme variants.

Thanks for reading.
You guys are doing great work. :)"

I was getting errors like ""Error processing prompt: Invalid control character at: line 563 column 62 (char 47769)"" while running exo. While investigating the problem I came across a corrupted index.json file:

>         return await download_file(..., use_range_request=False)

As ChatGPT says, ""After that code block, there’s no return or raise if downloaded_size != total_size. The function simply “falls through” to this part.""

253,679b77b8cbe8284d7a732958,issue,software quality -> fixing -> supporting debugging,https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci143/issues/588,"Difficulty searching reviews-notw-full.json by book title
I'm having trouble searching the `reviews-notw-full.json` file by book title. The JSON format of the file doesn't include the book title field directly. *I used chatGPT to trouble shoot when writing the script, which could have lead to things being overcomplicated.*

The two things I needed advice on are: 

1. Modify the command to select only 20 reviews and pass them to the LLM.
2. Properly implement the `summarize_reviews.sh` script to summarize reviews for any given book title.

## Command Example for Passing Reviews to LLM

Current command I use to pass top 20 reviews to the LLM:

```
$ echo ""Write a short 2-3 sentence summary of the following book reviews. The reviews are: $(cat ./reviews-notw-full.json | jq '.review_text' | head -n 20)"" | llm
```
## Current `summarize_reviews.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Create a temporary directory and change into it
tempdir=$(mktemp -d)
cd ""$tempdir""

# Check if a book title is provided
if [ -z ""$1"" ]; then
  echo ""Usage: sh summarize_reviews.sh \""<book title>\""""
  exit 1
fi

# Set the book title
BOOK_TITLE=""$1""

REVIEWS_FILE=""/data/users_bigdata/mplush/reviews-notw-full.json""

# Check if the reviews file exists
echo ""Looking for file at: $REVIEWS_FILE""  # Debugging line
if [ ! -f ""$REVIEWS_FILE"" ]; then
  echo ""Error: Reviews file for '$BOOK_TITLE' not found.""
  exit 1
fi

# Generate and pass the summary prompt to the LLM
echo ""book to summarize is: $BOOK_TITLE""
echo ""Write a short 2-3 sentence summary of the following book reviews. The reviews are: $(cat ""$REVIEWS_FILE"" | shuf | jq '.review_text' | head -n 20)"" | llm

# Clean up the temporary directory after the script finishes
rm -rf ""$tempdir""
```

Regardless of what book title is entered, the script only provides summaries for **""The Name of the Wind""**. For example:

```bash
$ sh summarize_reviews.sh ""The Name of the Wind""
Looking for file at: /data/users_bigdata/mplush/reviews-notw-full.json
book to summarize is: The Name of the Wind
Here is a short 2-3 sentence summary of the book reviews: The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss has received widespread acclaim for its engaging story, well-developed characters, and detailed world-building. Many reviewers have praised the book's unique blend of fantasy and realism, as well as its relatable protagonist, Kvothe, who is both talented and flawed. Despite some criticisms of the book's slow pace and abrupt ending, the majority of reviewers have highly recommended the book, with many considering it one of the best fantasy novels they've ever read.
```

```bash
$ sh summarize_reviews.sh ""The Wealth of Nations""
Looking for file at: /data/users_bigdata/mplush/reviews-notw-full.json
book to summarize is: The Wealth of Nations
Here is a short 2-3 sentence summary of the book reviews:

The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, with many readers praising its engaging storyline, well-developed characters, and immersive world-building. However, some reviewers have noted that the book's pacing can be slow at times, and that the female characters are somewhat one-dimensional and lack agency. Overall, the book has been praised for its unique narrative style and its ability to evoke strong emotions in readers, with many reviewers eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series.
```

## Missing Concept

I need help understanding how to:

1. Filter reviews from `reviews-notw-full.json` by the given book title.
2. Adjust the `jq` in the script to extract reviews for the entered title.

Thank you for your help!

I tried to adopt all of the discussions and open points from the old PR + I made some changes which I'm happy to discuss.

Some of the changes:

1. I merged both local API and the web site API into one proto file. The site/sites distinction was very confusing even for me (considering I was the one who created them).
2. I finally named method `RemoveSite` instead of `DeleteSite`. I guess @ericvicenti was right, and it's a more appropriate name. I guess we have `AddSite` instead of `CreateSite` for the same reason, so no big deal diverging from API guidelines.
3. I named (with the help of ChatGPT 😀) ""WebPublicationRecord"" the ""instance"" of a `document+version+path` on a given server. The server can have more than one of these records for a single document.
4. I added method to the local API to list these records for a given document among all of the configured sites.
5. There's also a method the actual Site is exposing to list all of the publications it has.

### Description
This pull request adds a new feature that allows users to share the content and settings of the chart currently displayed on the screen. The feature is implemented by generating a shareable URL that contains all the relevant data needed to reproduce the chart.

The shareable URL can be accessed by clicking the new ""Share"" button on the chart toolbar. When clicked, the button generates a URL that can be copied and shared with others. When a recipient clicks the URL, they will be taken to a new page that displays the chart using the same data and settings as the original chart.

### Changes
- Added a new ""Share"" button to the chart toolbar
- Implemented logic to generate a shareable URL that contains the chart data and settings
### Testing
- Manual testing was performed to ensure that the shareable URL was generated correctly and that the chart displayed correctly when accessed from the URL
- Unit tests were added to test the shareable URL generation logic (yeah, sure... 😅)
### Notes
- This feature will make it easier for users to share charts with others, and can also be used for collaboration and troubleshooting purposes.
- The shareable URL is not encrypted or protected, so caution should be taken when sharing sensitive data.

<!-- Thanks for contributing to Gutenberg! Please follow the Gutenberg Contributing Guidelines:
https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md -->

## What?
<!-- In a few words, what is the PR actually doing? -->

Improves the matching for URLs vs Entity Searches when typing in the Link Control search box.

Also removes the direct entry ""suggestion"" when an entity is returned.

Part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50178

## Why?
<!-- Why is this PR necessary? What problem is it solving? Reference any existing previous issue(s) or PR(s), but please add a short summary here, too -->

It's required by https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50178 to simplify the process of:

- selecting a search result
- adding a direct entry URL
- creating a page (note: this option will become less of a concern as we will move this as part of https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891).

## How?
<!-- How is your PR addressing the issue at hand? What are the implementation details? -->

Updates the `isURLLike` method by removing the very ""open"" `isURL` check which allowed pretty much anything to be technically valid. That's correct but in our case we want to limit the ""URL"" suggestion prompt to be only when it's prettry obviously a domain. So this result should now only show if:

- it's a valid protocol (http(s), ftp, mailto...etc)
- it's an internal link `#something`
- it starts with `www.`
- it has something that looks like a TLD (`wordpress.org`).

That's likely to exclude some edge cases that are technically valid URLs. However the approach previously which tried to account for any possible URL made the UX poorer by saying ""this is a URL"" even when it probably wasn't (e.g. `heelloiamnotaurl`).

This trades accuracy for an improved UX.


Note that I used ChatGPT to help me scaffold out the regex for the TLD helper. 


## Testing Instructions
<!-- Please include step by step instructions on how to test this PR. -->
<!-- 1. Open a Post or Page. -->
<!-- 2. Insert a Heading Block. -->
<!-- 3. etc. -->

- Add a paragraph
- Add a link.
- Try searching for a page.
- See that search results display but without any result for ""direct entry""
- Try another link, this time entering things that would seem like ""URLs"" to you. 
- Check the system accurately recognises these and does not show entity search results but rather displays the ""URL"" suggestion for you to click on.
- You should never see both entity results and direct entry URL result at the same time.
- Check that it's still possible to manually enter any input even if it's not recognised as a URL. In the future we need to follow up with _validation_ which will _strictly_ check the type of input is a valid URL using `isURL`.

### Testing Instructions for Keyboard

Please review this as I am not a C++ developer and used chatGPT to help me get this compiled and running. 

1. **Deprecation of `std::ptr_fun<int, int>` and `std::not1` in string trimming functions**

   The `std::ptr_fun` and `std::not1` functions were deprecated in C++17 and removed in C++20. These functions were used in the `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::ltrim` and `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::rtrim` functions. To ensure compatibility with C++17 and later, we replaced these functions with equivalent lambda expressions.

   In `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::ltrim`:

   ```cpp
   void wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::ltrim(std::string &s) {
       s.erase(s.begin(), std::find_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](int ch) {
           return !std::isspace(ch);
       }));
   }
   ```

   In `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::rtrim`:

   ```cpp
   void wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::rtrim(std::string &s) {
       s.erase(std::find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), [](int ch) {
           return !std::isspace(ch);
       }).base(), s.end());
   }
   ```

2. **Truncation of `snprintf` output**

   The output of the `snprintf` function in `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::hex2string` was getting truncated. This was because the size of the buffer passed to `snprintf` did not account for the null-terminating character. We adjusted the buffer size to prevent truncation.

   In `wifibeat::utils::stringHelper::hex2string`:

   ```cpp
   snprintf(ret + (i *3), 3, ""%02x"", data[i + offset]);
   ```
   and
   ```cpp
   snprintf(ret + (i * 2), 3, ""%02x"", data[i + offset]);
   ```

3. **'PMKSA' not recognized in `Tins::RSNInformation::AKMSuites`**

   The code contained a switch case for `RSNInformation::AKMSuites::PMKSA`, but 'PMKSA' is not a recognized member of `Tins::RSNInformation::AKMSuites`. To resolve this, we removed the `RSNInformation::AKMSuites::PMKSA` case.

   Changes in the switch statement:

   ```cpp
   switch(item) {
       case RSNInformation::AKMSuites::PSK:
           jo->Add(""type"", 1ULL);
           jo->Add(""value"", (oui * 256) + 1);
           jo->Add(""value_parsed"", string(""PSK""));
           break;
       default:
           jo->Add(""type"", string(""unknown""));
           break;
   }
   ```

4. **Missing `libnl-genl-3` during compilation**

   During the compilation of the project, the linker could not find the `libnl-genl-3` library. This was resolved by installing the `libnl-genl-3-dev` package on the system.

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libnl-genl-3-dev
   ```

These changes were necessary to resolve compilation errors and update deprecated functions. The changes ensure that the code is compatible with modern versions of C++ and that the necessary libraries are correctly linked during compilation."

This is a pull request.
It's used to perform code reviews.
It's a process where you're able to describe and compare the code you changed against the code that's being changed.

Given the nature of our organization and community, we'll introduce pull requests early and allow them to grow and evolve over time.

# Why Was This Code Changed

I took a look at the issues list #13 and thought about the size of the application. It's supposed to be small and simple to use. It should be so easy, a robot can work with it!

So we're starting off by organizing the words used. We're doing this to make the application _bilingual friendly_. The reason we're doing this is because bilingual speaking is interesting and a lot of people speak it. 

The process of transforming your application into a bilingual one is by simply mapping out the words & using chatGPT to create appropriate replications. The toggle/selection picks the head of the list, in this case ""english,  spanish"" and processes the words in the application.

Putting this up as a WIP, in case others have suggestions or comments on this added command.

This PR adds a new command, `flux watch` for lack of a better name (I asked ChatGPT and one of its suggestions was `flux gazemancer` but that was just a bit too outlandish). This command basically does the same thing as `flux submit --watch` but can monitor all running jobs, all inactive jobs, or a specific set of jobs. (It has a similar set of options as `flux jobs`, `flux pstree` etc.).

This allows users to submit many jobs then watch then with `flux watch`, e.g. at the end of a batch script, or if you need to run multiple `submit` or `bulksubmit` commands to submit a set of jobs and then want to monitor them all, e.g. `flux watch --all --progress`...

I still need to think more about the set of options here, write tests, etc. But that should go fairly quickly since this is actually a pretty simple command."

--> what:
the TTS (text to speech) speed has fixed settings of 0.25-0.5-0.75-1.00-1.25- and so on. 

I implemented a custom speed option. 
So now you will be able to type in numbers between 0 to 5 and with 2 decimal places. 
So the value 1.1 will work. 

--> how:
After setting up my the dev environment, this is where I had like 74 updates in git for making the files multi line. 
I added it in BookReader/plugins/plugin.tts.js

After having a multiline implementation i asked ChatGPT to convert the new code i wrote into single line format that the current plugin.tts.js requires. 

So thats where we are. After testing it I am now making a pull request.

**TL;DR – when firing a mutation, we need to explicitly specify which fragments we want to update in the relay cache.** 

Without specifying the `PostComposerModalFragment` to be updated after calling `useSyncTokens`, the tokens remained stale in the post composer despite refreshing. The exact same issue occurred in the Editor in the past, which was fixed with #1659.

The way we need to remember to list which fragments to update in the relay cache is very annoying. I asked ChatGPT why this is necessary, and it provided some pros / cons:

Hi Lars,
I created this install script to go along with your project. I did use ChatGPT to make the process a little faster, but I did look over it and test it before this pull request.

I incorporated your install instructions. One thing I found is that the ""./backend/update.pl"" command has to be run inside that folder (likely due to references to other ""./backend"" files) and specify the full path of frontend/data.json (or use bash shortcuts like ../frontend/data.json).

### Explanation from ChatGPT ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

> Adding types to package.json exports helps typescript find the type declarations of your package.
> 
> Before you added the ""types"" field to your ""exports"", TypeScript couldn’t find your type declarations through the ""exports"" field. But when you set moduleResolution to ""node"", TypeScript fell back to looking for an index.d.ts file in your module’s root directory. Since your type declarations were there, TypeScript was able to find them, and you didn’t see any error.
> 
> However, it’s generally better to specify all your module’s entry points (including type declarations) in the ""exports"" field. This way, you’re not relying on TypeScript’s fallback behavior, which might not work in all environments or future versions of TypeScript. Plus, it makes your package’s interface clearer to other developers. That’s why adding ""types"": ""./dist/index.d.ts"" to your package.json is a good solution."

**Description**

- Combine/extend @hirasso's 2 PRs: [rapid navigation](https://github.com/swup/swup/pull/825) + [queue navigation](https://github.com/swup/swup/pull/834)
- Add `Visit.state` property and `visit:abort` hook

**Features**

- Convert the `Visit` object to a class
- Pass around the `Visit` object to avoid global mutations
- Add a `state` property to the `Visit` object
  - created → queued → started → leaving → loaded → entering → completed / aborted / failed
- Queue new visit if the current visit is already past the `loaded` state
  - Otherwise, abort the visit and return early in strategic places
  - When aborting only during the `entering` phase, we can have fewer return clauses throughout the code
- Only run hooks if visit is not aborted
- Create `visit:abort` hook to allow undoing dom changes like in `visit:end`
- Always clear `is-leaving` class

**Notes**

- Regarding the naming (`visit.aborted`, `visit:abort`), I asked ChatGPT for a few suggestions and that's what it came up with. I switched to `abort` to see how it feels. I actually quite like it, slightly more than `cancel`. But we can switch back to `cancel` no problem.

As discussed in the [2023-11-29 biweekly call](https://hackmd.io/y4mSQc_EROqTOx4KWfM6jQ), this PR prepares for a formal-schema-first approach by switching from Sphinx to Docusaurus.

Based on my research, Docusaurus appears to be the most mature documentation site generator that supports JSON Schema draft 2020-12 (sphinx-jsonschema only supports draft 4, which is now ten years old!). I remember reading that draft 2020-12 should be ""close to stable"", so I think it makes sense for us to use that as our JSON Schema version moving forward.

If you'd like to [preview these changes](https://ethdebug.on.fleek.co/format/), I quickly set up a [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) project, which provides a service to build+deploy GH repos as static IPFS sites behind their CDN. This service might be nice for us to use for PR/branch previews, since they provide that feature out of the box. (This PR just keeps the existing GHA deployment to gh-pages, though... I don't think we want to switch entirely to Fleek? At least now in this PR.)

For a breakdown of the various moving parts, this PR includes changes that:
- Remove Sphinx stuff
- Prepare formal schema by starting a `schemas/` directory with some rough sketches in YAML
- Setup Docusaurus within `web/` directory:
  - Initialize Docusaurus and remove all the default stuff (logos, blog, etc.)
  - Establish `docs/` subdirectory for human-readable content about ethdebug, our efforts, etc.
  - Establish `spec/` subdirectory for direct specification materials, using Docusaurus's mechanism for keeping two ""docs"" directories.
  - Author basic homepage so ethdebug has a proper home on the web
  - Define initial version of function for loading schemas from root `schema/` directory, and reference this schema in the `spec/` subdirectory.
  - Extend theme to provide access to FontAwesome for icons
  - Extend theme to include ""external link"" badge on external links in Markdown files
  - Include a temporary logo generated by ChatGPT
  - Override default colors with temporary colorscheme suggested by ChatGPT
- Update GitHub Actions workflows for new toolchain"

This PR pushes the listing components `parameters` to the URL, so that you can bookmark, refresh and navigate back/forwards while maintaining the selected sort, filters, search, columns, page etc.

This is an opt-in feature of the listing mixin, since it might not make sense for all types of listing, especially when you have more than one on the same page (eg. Dashboard). To enable it set `pushQuery` to `true`.

I have enabled it for the main entry, term and user listings.

The `additionalParameters` are not pushed to the URL, since the listing mixin wont know what they are or how to handle them.

I asked ChatGPT for the `utf8atob` function, it seems to work fine but I have no idea if it's perfect.

I tried using ast-grep many times, but I was never able to get it to work and have the query return what I want. I just tried tree-grepper and in about 10 minutes, with the help of the Tree-sitter ""`:Inspect`"" Playground in Neovim, which looks like this:

but before actually getting to try it out, I had a lot of trouble and wasted quite a lot of time trying to get to try to use it, by building it, since trying out the Nix package manager on Arch didn't work for me, it didn't install correctly and outputs something something ""socket permission error"" when I try to use a Nix command.

I think enabling only a Cargo build option, without Nix, would be helpful to a lot more people and would enable a lot more people to try the software. a Cargo only build would also enable you to [publish a pre-built binary to crates.io](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-04-installing-binaries.html#:~:text=Note%20that%20you,within%20other%20programs.), so it would make installing for people even more easier.

Corrected wording for `accessibilityHint`. Move from ""future simple"" to ""present simple"" tense.

## 💡 Motivation and Context

I missed ""the"" article and decided to add it. But then I asked ChatGPT what else can be improved and ChatGPT suggested to write everything in present simple tense. I kind of agree, because we describe what button does, not what it will do.

Hello :octocat: 

I've written this file months ago and gave it to my students that use windows.

See https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/issues/1414. WDYT?

PS: I'm not familiar with bat at all. I've asked ChatGPT to convert the bash version into bat and inspected the results to make sure nothing weird was added. One thing I noticed is that killing the bat doesn't kill Apalache, which would be ideal. I looked at [this template](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/blob/e72f2f45b8cab5881add1cd62743bfc69c2b9b4d/src/main/resources/com/typesafe/sbt/packager/archetypes/scripts/bat-template) as basis (as the bash refers to this set of templates) but couldn't find how to set that up.

## Summary by Sourcery

Refactor the RAMSTKCommonDB and BaseDatabase classes to simplify methods, improve error handling, and enhance type annotations. Update tests to improve output readability.

Enhancements:
- Simplify the initialization of attributes in the RAMSTKCommonDB class by removing unnecessary comments and unused attributes.
- Refactor input handling in the _do_add_administrator method to remove redundant comments and improve readability.
- Streamline the _do_create_database method by consolidating parameter descriptions and removing redundant comments.
- Improve error handling in the do_create_postgres_db function by logging errors and raising a DataAccessError.
- Refactor the do_execute_query method to return a more precise type using SQLAlchemy's Row and Sequence types.
- Update the get_database_session method to return both the engine and scoped session, enhancing its utility.

Tests:
- Change the color code in the test for the fail_read_license message broadcast to improve test output readability.

Summary (blame ChatGPT for any wrong numbers):

| operation | `master` average | branch average | diff |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `generate` | 0.48ms | 0.55ms | -14% |
| `prepare` | 40.55ms | 17.31ms | 57% |
| `render` | 36.88ms | 21.66ms | 41% |

`generate` is already very fast and doesn't use elements to begin with, so I'm inclined to say that the difference here is just due to normal variation.

Note that these changes will really only help with questions that use a given element multiple times. The improvement this will yield is proportional to the number of times an element is reused."

👋 @lorant-one @zsofiakm!

Here is the first draft of the `next-intl` based i18n.

For reference, it's based on one of next-intl examples ([source](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/tree/main/examples/example-app-router-without-i18n-routing), [demo](https://next-intl-example-app-router-without-i18n-routing.vercel.app/login)).

## Some notes

- I kept the default logic of setting/getting the locale via a cookie, not sure if/how we would want to adapt this.
- The locale toggle is dynamically generated from the configured locales. This might not be ideal if the number of locales is high, but it's probably sufficient in the context of a portfolio. (Switching to a dropdown is a possibility, but I like the toggle look.
- The `mdx` content (posts/projects) now lives in localized subdirectories. In the current example I kept the same filenames across the two locales, so that switching is transparent. (If the names differ, switching locale will lead to 404. It might be adaptable, to redirect properly, but I did not dig deep in the code, and I like the simplicity of having next-intl triggering the state change.)
- I translated the projects and blog posts with ChatGPT for the sake of the example. (Using Indonesian to fit the profile!)

## Questions

My main question at this stage is: **how do we want to handle the `content.js` file?**

`next-intl` allows to grab the localized content (from `i18n/messages/{locale}.json` via the `useTranslations` hook, but that's not callable from `content.js`.

I have two solutions on the top of my head, but neither might be the best here:
1. deep restructuring of the `content.js` file, only keeping ""settings""-like things there, and handle the localized content elsewhere:
  a. retrieve the various translations in the pages via scoped `t(X)` calls;
  b. define a specific `getContent((t) => {...}` function to call in the various pages, and return a relatively equivalent structure (not sure it would work properly);
2. somewhat similar to 1.b. but passing the needed content through props (not sure if more efficient)

#### Summary

Features ""Add a new widget to display weight as ""##.#/##.#[unit]""""

#### Purpose of change

I felt like this was a glaring hole in the information you could display in the sidebar, considering all the random stuff you can display over there, so I fixed it.

#### Describe the solution

Added a new functions in display,cpp to pull current units and concat current weight with max weight, and calculate what percent of the max they are to color them appropriately, then added the requisite code to widget.cpp to call on this information. 

I then added a new widgets to legacy labels sidebar to display this new information, because that's the sidebar I use. If anyone wants it added to another sidebar, speak up.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered

Not doing the imperial version because pounds make no sense

#### Additional context

I'd like to thank my gf for being patient with me while I ignored the show we were watching all day today, and I'd like to thank chatGPT for holding my hand and helping me setup the compiler in visual code, and helping me with c++ syntax because my coding experience is limited to java from 15 years ago, and lua from writing software in the minecraft computercraft mod

My head hurts

I'd also like to thank @Zenefess for giving me some guidance on how widgets work when I first thought about doing this a month or two ago

Should probably rename the existing carry_weight_text variables to denote that they handle the carry weight as a percent, because it's somewhat ambiguous"

Solved the error we were facing yesterday trying to import cacheIt. Due to how specific it was I used chatgpt to help but here's what I gathered from my own understanding:
Problem: So from what I'm understanding the errors occurred because the client side package wasn't properly compiling  typescript into javascript files and typescript declaration files which were the .d.ts names files. Since it wasn't compiling the declaration files Typescript couldn't find the types.
How it Occured:
So our typescript config has an option to create declaration files and we didn't enable that option
The OutDir and RootDir within the typescript config also weren't set properly. What we want to happen is for all the necessary files to be compiled to the dist folder
How I fixed it:
To fix it I tweaked the typescript config to make sure it generated type declaration files
I also made sure the outDir points and compiles to the dist folder"
